AB  - Sturge-Weber syndrome is a sporadic congenital neurocutaneous disorder caused by a 
      somatic activating mutation in GNAQ; it affects 1 in every 20,000 to 50,000 
      newborns. It is characterized by a facial Port-wine stain, leptomeningeal 
      angiomatosis, and glaucoma. Seizures are the most common neurological manifestation 
      and typically present in the first months of life. Glaucoma may be present at birth 
      or develop later. Neuroimaging studies show leptomeningeal angiomatosis, supporting 
      diagnosis. Standard treatment for Sturge-Weber syndrome includes laser treatment for 
      the Port-wine stain, anticonvulsants, and medical or surgical treatment for the 
      glaucoma. Prognosis depends on the extent of leptomeningeal involvement and the 
      severity of the glaucoma.

AB  - Mastocytosis is a disorder of abnormal mast cell proliferation, with clinical 
      features that include flushing, pruritus, abdominal pain, diarrhea, hypotension, 
      syncope, and musculoskeletal pain. These features are the result of mast cell 
      mediator release and infiltration into target organs. Patients of all ages may be 
      affected, although in children, manifestations primarily involve the skin. Most 
      patients with systemic disease have a somatically acquired activating mutation in 
      the KIT oncogene. This article discusses the causes and pathogenesis of 
      mastocytosis, with an overview of the clinical features and the approach to 
      diagnosis, evaluation, and therapy in adults and pediatric patients.

AB  - GI stromal tumors (GISTs) are neoplasms with a varying malignancy potential ranging 
      from virtually indolent tumors to rapidly progressing cancers. GISTs occur 
      throughout the intestinal tract, and most harbor an activating mutation in either 
      KIT or platelet-derived growth factor A ( PDGFRA). Diagnosis is made using 
      immunohistochemistry, but molecular testing with mutation analysis is paramount for 
      selection of appropriate therapy. Most small GISTs are cured with surgery. Tyrosine 
      kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy has led to substantial improvements in survival, both 
      for patients with localized GIST and those with advanced disease. Adjuvant therapy 
      with imatinib benefits patients with a high risk of recurrence, with studies 
      suggesting most benefit with at least 3 years of therapy. Neoadjuvant imatinib 
      therapy should be considered for patients requiring extensive surgery, aiming at 
      shrinking the tumor to allow organ preservation and less extensive surgery. The 
      following three TKIs have been approved for the management of advanced disease: 
      imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib; imatinib is usually the best tolerated of the 
      three and the standard first-line treatment. TKIs benefit the majority of patients 
      with advanced GIST but have no or limited efficacy in patients with the PDGFRA D842V 
      mutation or patients with GIST lacking KIT and PDGFRA mutations. Surgery, the 
      mainstay of primary tumor management, also plays a role in the advanced disease 
      setting for selected patients, as do some other approaches such as palliative 
      radiation therapy. Research continues to identify novel therapies, in particular 
      effective agents to treat TKI-refractory disease.

TI  - Erdheim-Chester disease.
PG  - 1311-1318
LID - 10.1182/blood.2019002766 [doi]
AB  - Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD) is characterized by the infiltration of tissues by 
      foamy CD68+CD1a- histiocytes, with 1500 known cases since 1930. Mutations activating 
      the MAPK pathway are found in more than 80% of patients with ECD, mainly the 
      BRAFV600E activating mutation in 57% to 70% of cases, followed by MAP2K1 in close to 
      20%. The discovery of BRAF mutations and of other MAP kinase pathway alterations, as 
      well as the co-occurrence of ECD with LCH in 15% of patients with ECD, led to the 
      2016 revision of the classification of histiocytoses in which LCH and ECD belong to 
      the "L" group. Both conditions are considered inflammatory myeloid neoplasms. Ten 
      percent of ECD cases are associated with myeloproliferative neoplasms and/or 
      myelodysplastic syndromes. Some of the most striking signs of ECD are the long bone 
      involvement (80%-95%), as well as the hairy kidney appearance on computed tomography 
      scan (63%), the coated aorta (40%), and the right atrium pseudo-tumoral infiltration 
      (36%). Central nervous system involvement is a strong prognostic factor and 
      independent predictor of death. Interferon-α seems to be the best initial treatment 
      of ECD. Since 2012, more than 200 patients worldwide with multisystem or refractory 
      ECD have benefitted from highly effective therapy with BRAF and MEK inhibitors. 
      Targeted therapies have an overall, robust, and reproducible efficacy in ECD, with 
      no acquired resistance to date, but their use may be best reserved for the most 
      severe manifestations of the disease, as they may be associated with serious adverse 
      effects and as-yet-unknown long-term consequences.

AB  - Sturge-Weber syndrome is the third most common neurocutaneous disorder, after 
      neurofibromatosis and tuberous sclerosis, and impacts approximately 1 in 20000 live 
      births. Sturge-Weber syndrome is not inherited, but rather occurs exclusively 
      sporadically, in both males and females and in all races and ethnic backgrounds. 
      Sturge-Weber syndrome presents at birth with a capillary malformation on the face 
      (port-wine birthmark) with later diagnosis of abnormal vasculature in the eye and 
      the brain which result in a range of complications. The underlying somatic mosaic 
      mutation causing both Sturge-Weber syndrome and isolated port-wine birthmarks was 
      recently discovered and is an activating mutation in GNAQ. When a newborn presents 
      with a facial port-wine birthmark on the upper face, that child has a 15-50% risk of 
      developing Sturge-Weber syndrome brain and/or eye involvement, depending on the 
      extent of the birthmark, and close monitoring and appropriate screening is essential 
      for early diagnosis and optimal treatment. Treatment options include laser therapy 
      for lightening of the birthmark, eye drops and surgery for glaucoma management, and 
      aggressive anticonvulsant treatment, low dose aspirin, and neurosurgery where 
      necessary. Future possible treatments based upon new knowledge of the somatic 
      mutation and downstream pathways are currently being considered and studied.

TI  - Efficacy of PI3K inhibitors in advanced breast cancer.
PG  - x12-x20
LID - 10.1093/annonc/mdz381 [doi]
AB  - The phosphoinositide 3 (PI3)-kinase/Akt signaling pathway has always been a focus of 
      interest in breast cancer due to its role in cell growth, cell proliferation, cell 
      migration and deregulated apoptosis. Its activation has been linked to endocrine 
      resistance and worse prognosis in certain subgroups of breast cancer. In addition, 
      deregulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway including PIK3CA activating mutation is 
      frequently present in breast cancer. Multiple efforts have been carried out to 
      target this pathway, initially with pan-PI3K inhibitors with some hint of activity 
      but hampered by their limiting side-effects. A recent large randomized trial in 
      patients with endocrine-resistant PIK3CA-mutant hormone receptor (HR)-positive 
      tumors led to the approval of the first PI3K inhibitor, alpelisib, in combination 
      with fulvestrant. The specificity of alpelisib against the p110α catalytic isoform 
      provided additional efficacy and a better toxicity profile. In this review, we 
      summarize the main research with PI3K inhibitors in breast cancer and we provide 
      some insight of potential future combinations of this treatment in breast cancer 
      patients.

AB  - The discovery of activating mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) 
      gene and development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) of EGFR have achieved a 
      paradigm shift in treatment strategy of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). For 
      advanced NSCLC harboring activating EGFR mutations, an EGFR-TKI is preferably 
      prescribed as it provides a superior survival benefit over platinum-based 
      chemotherapy. To further improve the therapeutic outcomes, more potent EGFR-TKIs 
      through irreversible inhibition of tyrosine kinase have been developed. In a recent 
      clinical trial, an irreversible EGFR-TKI (osimertinib) showed a superior survival 
      benefit with lower toxicity profile. In addition, combination treatments such as an 
      EGFR-TKI plus platinum-based chemotherapy may achieve a long-term survival. For 
      earlier-stage resectable NSCLC with EGFR-mutations, several clinical trials to 
      assess the efficacy of EGFR-TKIs in pre-operative induction setting and in 
      postoperative adjuvant setting are now ongoing. Here we review and discuss the 
      current status and future perspectives of treatment for EGFR-mutated NSCLC.

AB  - Gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs) are mesenchymal neoplasms that arise in the 
      gastrointestinal tract, usually in the stomach or the small intestine and rarely 
      elsewhere in the abdomen. They can occur at any age, the median age being 60-65 
      years, and typically cause bleeding, anaemia, and pain. GISTs have variable 
      malignant potential, ranging from small lesions with a benign behaviour to fatal 
      sarcomas. Most tumours stain positively for the mast/stem cell growth factor 
      receptor KIT and anoctamin 1 and harbour a kinase-activating mutation in either KIT 
      or PDGFRA. Tumours without such mutations could have alterations in genes of the 
      succinate dehydrogenase complex or in BRAF, or rarely RAS family genes. About 60% of 
      patients are cured by surgery. Adjuvant treatment with imatinib is recommended for 
      patients with a substantial risk of recurrence, if the tumour has an 
      imatinib-sensitive mutation. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors substantially improve 
      survival in advanced disease, but secondary drug resistance is common.

AB  - Treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring epidermal growth factor 
      receptor (EGFR) activating mutation with EGFR-TKIs has achieved great success, yet 
      faces the development of acquired resistance as the major obstacle to long-term 
      disease remission in the clinic. MET (or c-MET) gene amplification has long been 
      known as an important resistance mechanism to first- or second-generation EGFR-TKIs 
      in addition to the appearance of T790 M mutation. Recent preclinical and clinical 
      studies have suggested that MET amplification and/or protein hyperactivation is 
      likely to be a key mechanism underlying acquired resistance to third-generation 
      EGFR-TKIs such as osimertinib as well, particularly when used as a first-line 
      therapy. EGFR-mutant NSCLCs that have relapsed from first-generation EGFR-TKI 
      treatment and have MET amplification and/or protein hyperactivation should be 
      insensitive to osimertinib monotherapy. Therefore, combinatorial therapy with 
      osimertinib and a MET or even a MEK inhibitor should be considered for these 
      patients with resistant NSCLC carrying MET amplification and/or protein 
      hyperactivation.

AB  - Hypoglycemia is defined by a low blood glucose level associated to clinical 
      symptoms. Hypoglycemia may be related to treatment of diabetes, but also to drugs, 
      alcohol, critical illness, cortisol insufficiency including hypopituitarism, 
      insulinoma, bariatric or gastric surgery, pancreas transplantation or glucagon 
      deficiency, or may be surreptitious. Some hypoglycemic episodes remain unexplained, 
      and genetic, paraneoplastic and immune causes should be considered. Genetic causes 
      may be related to endogenous hyperinsulinism and to inborn errors of metabolism 
      (IEM). Endogenous hyperinsulinism is related to monogenic congenital 
      hyperinsulinism, and especially to mutations of the glucokinase-activating gene or 
      of insulin receptors, both characterised by postprandial hypoglycemia with major 
      hyperinsulinism. In adulthood, IEM-related hypoglycemia can persist in a previously 
      diagnosed childhood disease or may be a presenting sign. It is suggested by systemic 
      involvement (rhabdomyolysis after fasting or exercising, heart disease, 
      hepatomegaly), sometimes associated to a family history of hypoglycemia. The timing 
      of hypoglycemic episodes with respect to the last meal also helps to orientate 
      diagnosis. Fasting hypoglycemia may be related to type 0, I or III glycogen 
      synthesis disorder, fatty acid oxidation or gluconeogenesis disorder. Postprandial 
      hypoglycemia may be related to inherited fructose intolerance. Exercise-induced 
      hyperinsulinism is mainly related to activating mutation of the SLC16A1 gene. 
      Besides exceptional ectopic insulin secretion, paraneoplastic causes involve NICTH 
      (Non-Islet-Cell Tumour Hypoglycemia), caused by Big-IGF2 secretion by a large 
      tumour, with low blood levels of insulin, C-peptide and IGF1. Autoimmune causes 
      involve antibodies against insulin (HIRATA syndrome), especially in case of Graves' 
      disease, or against the insulin receptor. Medical history, timing, and insulin level 
      orientate the diagnosis.

AB  - The phosphoinositide 3 (PI3)-kinase/Akt signaling pathway has always been a focus of 
      interest in breast cancer due to its role in cell growth, cell proliferation, cell 
      migration and deregulated apoptosis. Its activation has been linked to endocrine 
      resistance and worse prognosis in certain subgroups of breast cancer. In addition, 
      deregulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway including PIK3CA activating mutation is 
      frequently present in breast cancer. Multiple efforts have been carried out to 
      target this pathway, initially with pan-PI3K inhibitors with some hint of activity 
      but hampered by their limiting side-effects. A recent large randomized trial in 
      patients with endocrine-resistant PIK3CA-mutant hormone receptor (HR)-positive 
      tumors led to the approval of the first PI3K inhibitor, alpelisib, in combination 
      with fulvestrant. The specificity of alpelisib against the p110α catalytic isoform 
      provided additional efficacy and a better toxicity profile. In this review, we 
      summarize the main research with PI3K inhibitors in breast cancer and we provide 
      some insight of potential future combinations of this treatment in breast cancer 
      patients.

TI  - CLOVES syndrome: review of a PIK3CA-related overgrowth spectrum (PROS).
PG  - 14-21
LID - 10.1111/cge.12832 [doi]
AB  - Overgrowth syndromes are characterized by global or localized disproportionate 
      growth associated with other anomalies, including vascular malformations and 
      neurological and/or visceral disorders. CLOVES (Congenital Lipomatous asymmetric 
      Overgrowth of the trunk with lymphatic, capillary, venous, and combined-type 
      Vascular malformations, Epidermal naevi, Scoliosis/Skeletal and spinal anomalies) is 
      an overgrowth syndrome caused by mosaic activating mutation in gene PIK3CA, which 
      gives rise to abnormal PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway activation. These mutations are 
      responsible for the clinical manifestations of the syndrome, which include low- and 
      high-flow vascular malformations, thoracic lipomatous hyperplasia, asymmetric 
      growth, and visceral and neurological disorders. These common anomalies are 
      illustrated with figures from two personal cases. Identification of the clinical and 
      genetic characteristics of CLOVES syndrome is crucial for the differential diagnosis 
      with other overgrowth syndromes, such as Proteus or Klippel-Trenaunay (K-T) 
      syndromes, and for the therapeutic management of the different anomalies. In this 
      context, a new entity comprising different syndromes with phenotypic mutations in 
      PIK3CA has been proposed, designated PIK3CA-related overgrowth spectrum (PROS), with 
      the aim of facilitating clinical management and establishing appropriate genetic 
      study criteria.

TI  - Molecular Pathways: Targeting the CXCR4-CXCL12 Axis--Untapped Potential in the Tumor 
      Microenvironment.
PG  - 4278-85
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-14-0914 [doi]
AB  - Evidence suggests that the CXC-chemokine receptor-4 pathway plays a role in cancer 
      cell homing and metastasis, and thus represents a potential target for cancer 
      therapy. The homeostatic microenvironment chemokine CXCL12 binds the CXCR4 and CXCR7 
      receptors, activating divergent signals on multiple pathways, such as ERK1/2, p38, 
      SAPK/JNK, AKT, mTOR, and the Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK). An activating mutation in 
      CXCR4 is responsible for a rare disease, WHIM syndrome (warts, 
      hypogammaglobulinemia, infections, and myelokathexis), and dominant CXCR4 mutations 
      have also been reported in Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia. The CXCR4-CXCL12 axis 
      regulates the hematopoietic stem cell niche--a property that has led to the approval 
      of the CXCR4 antagonist plerixafor (AMD3100) for mobilization of hematopoietic 
      precursors. In preclinical models, plerixafor has shown antimetastatic potential in 
      vivo, offering proof of concept. Other antagonists are in preclinical and clinical 
      development. Recent evidence demonstrates that inhibiting CXCR4 signaling restores 
      sensitivity to CTLA-4 and PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors, creating a new line for 
      investigation. Targeting the CXCR4-CXCL12 axis thus offers the possibility of 
      affecting CXCR4-expressing primary tumor cells, modulating the immune response, or 
      synergizing with other targeted anticancer therapies.

TI  - BRAF-Mutated Colorectal Cancer: What Is the Optimal Strategy for Treatment?
PG  - 9
LID - 10.1007/s11864-017-0453-5 [doi]
AB  - The BRAF activating mutation, harbored by approximately 10% of colorectal cancers 
      (CRC), confers dramatic prognosis to advanced diseases. In early-stage setting, the 
      identification of the BRAF mutation does not impact the therapeutic decision. Yet, 
      the BRAF mutation could be considered as a stratification factor in adjuvant trials, 
      because of its prognostic impact after relapse. Moreover, both BRAF mutation and 
      mismatch repair (MMR) statuses should be determined in all CRC to help identify 
      sporadic tumors versus Lynch syndrome-related tumors. Indeed, in patients with 
      MMR-deficient (dMMR) tumors and MLH1 loss of expression, the BRAFV600E mutation 
      indicates a sporadic origin. In advanced BRAF-mutated CRC, the standard of care 
      remains fluoropyrimidine-based cytotoxic regimen in combination with bevacizumab. 
      Although a recent meta-analysis showed that there was insufficient data to justify 
      the exclusion of anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies, antiangiogenic agents should be 
      preferred in the first-line setting. Despite the lack of a randomized phase 3 study 
      dedicated to BRAF-mutated CRC, chemotherapy intensification combining a quadruple 
      association of 5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, irinotecan (FOLFOXIRI), and bevacizumab 
      seems like a valid option. Although first results with BRAF inhibitors as single 
      agents in BRAF-mutated CRC were disappointing, their association with therapies 
      targeting the MAPK pathway seems to overcome the primary resistance to BRAF 
      inhibition. In the field of sporadic CRC, the BRAF mutation is strongly associated 
      with MMR deficiency. Considering breakthrough results of immune checkpoint 
      inhibitors in dMMR repair tumors, determination of the MMR status appears to be 
      mandatory. Given the dramatic prognosis conferred by the BRAF mutation, patients 
      with BRAF-mutated advanced CRC need to be systematically identified and proposed for 
      clinical trial enrolment in order to benefit from innovative therapies.

TI  - Novel Third-Generation EGFR Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors and Strategies to Overcome 
      Therapeutic Resistance in Lung Cancer.
PG  - 689-698
LID - 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-18-1281 [doi]
AB  - EGFR-activating mutations are observed in approximately 15% to 20% of patients with 
      non-small cell lung cancer. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors have provided an illustrative 
      example of the successes in targeting oncogene addiction in cancer and the role of 
      tumor-specific adaptations conferring therapeutic resistance. The compound 
      osimertinib is a third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which was granted full 
      FDA approval in March 2017 based on targeting EGFR T790M resistance. The compound 
      has received additional FDA approval as first-line therapy with improvement in 
      progression-free survival by suppressing the activating mutation and preventing the 
      rise of the dominant resistance clone. Drug development has been breathtaking in 
      this space with other third-generation compounds at various stages of development: 
      rociletinib (CO-1686), olmutinib (HM61713), nazartinib (EGF816), naquotinib 
      (ASP8273), mavelertinib (PF-0647775), and AC0010. However, therapeutic resistance 
      after the administration of third-generation inhibitors is complex and not fully 
      understood, with significant intertumoral and intratumoral heterogeneity. Repeat 
      tissue and plasma analyses on therapy have revealed insights into multiple 
      mechanisms of resistance, including novel second site EGFR mutations, activated 
      bypass pathways such as MET amplification, HER2 amplification, RAS mutations, BRAF 
      mutations, PIK3CA mutations, and novel fusion events. Strategies to understand and 
      predict patterns of mutagenesis are still in their infancy; however, technologies to 
      understand synthetically lethal dependencies and track cancer evolution through 
      therapy are being explored. The expansion of combinatorial therapies is a direction 
      forward targeting minimal residual disease and bypass pathways early based on 
      projected resistance.

AB  - The discovery of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activating mutations in 
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and the success story of EGFR tyrosine kinases 
      inhibitors (TKIs) have changed the paradigm of cancer therapy from empirical 
      cytotoxic chemotherapy to molecular-targeted cancer therapy. As a result, EGFR TKI 
      therapy, including gefitinib, erlotinib and afatinib, has become the standard 
      therapy for NSCLC patients with EGFR activating mutation as first-line therapy. 
      However, most patients inevitably progress despite initial dramatic and rapid 
      response to EGFR TKIs and therefore during the last decade, a lot of efforts have 
      been made to identify and overcome various resistance mechanisms. Fortunately, T790M 
      secondary mutation, the main resistance mechanism, can be overcome by newly 
      developed third-generation EGFR TKIs, such as osimertinib, while most combination 
      trials trying to overcome resistance mechanisms other than T790M mutation have 
      failed so far. To make it worse, spatial and temporal tumor heterogeneity and clonal 
      selection or evolution are also identified in EGFR mutant NSCLC tumors. 
      Nevertheless, advance of comprehensive and more sensitive molecular diagnostics and 
      monitoring technology, such as next-generation sequencing and dynamic monitoring 
      technology using circulating biomarker and development of new cancer medicine with 
      different mechanisms from EGFR TKIs, especially immune checkpoint inhibitors, might 
      affect or change the treatment paradigm of EGFR mutant NSCLC in the near future.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Previous studies have indicated that EGFR exon 19 deletions in non-small 
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are associated with better outcomes to tyrosine kinase 
      inhibitors (TKIs) than the L858R mutation. This study aimed to evaluate whether 
      T790M, a resistant mutation, is more likely to coexist with L858R mutation than with 
      exon 19 deletions in pretreatment NSCLC patients. MATERIALS AND METHOD: We searched 
      MEDLINE and EMBASE up to Nov 30th, 2015 to identify randomized controlled trials 
      (RCTs) and observational studies that reported pretreatment T790M and 
      EGFR-activating mutation. A meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects 
      model. The primary outcome was odds ratio (OR) of pretreatment T790M mutation in 
      NSCLC co-existing with L858R mutation and exon 19 deletions. Stratified analysis was 
      performed based on sensitivity of mutation detection methods for T790M. RESULTS: We 
      identified 15 observational studies and 3 RCTs for analysis. Pretreatment T790M was 
      more frequent in L858R than in exon 19 mutated patients. The association of T790M 
      and L858R was statistically significant in observational studies (OR, 1.65, 95% CI, 
      1.17-2.32), with less precision in RCTs (OR, 1.84, 95% CI, 0.96-3.52). In the 
      stratified analysis based on the sensitivity of the mutation detection methods, the 
      association was observed in the studies using intermediately (detection limit <5% 
      and ≥ 0.1%; OR, 2.23, 95% CI, 1.19-4.17) and highly sensitive methods (detection 
      limit <0.1%; OR, 1.74, 95% CI, 1.10-2.73), but not in those using low sensitivity 
      methods (detection limit >5%; OR, 1.28, 95% CI, 0.74-2.23). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Pretreatment EGFR T790M mutation is more likely to coexist with L858R mutation than 
      with exon 19 deletions in NSCLC. This association was observed only in studies using 
      sensitive mutation detection methods (<5%).

AB  - Recent progress in the field of molecular biology has allowed us to identify at 
      least two different molecular mechanisms implicated in colorectal carcinogenesis 
      (CRC): chromosomal instability (CIN) and genetic instability. Even though the two 
      molecular mechanisms differ, their signalling pathways, implicated in malignant 
      transformation of colonic epithelial cells, appear to be similar. The most frequent 
      group of CRC, which represents 80% of sporadic CRC, is characterized by allelic 
      losses on the short arm of chromosome 17 and 8 and on the long arm of chromosome 5, 
      18 and 22. These allelic losses are associated with mutations in TP53, APC, SMAD2 
      and SMAD4 genes. All of these alterations are grouped under the phenotype CIN. 
      A genetic instability termed MSI (microsatellite instability), which results from a 
      mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency, appears in 12-15% of CRC cases. The presence of 
      MMR deficiency leads to the accumulation of mutations in genes controlling cell 
      cycle and apoptosis (TGFBRII, BAX or CASPASE5). More recently, the existence of a 
      third phenotype was suggested. The main alteration associated with this group of 
      tumors is the hypermethylation of the promoter region of numerous genes, leading to 
      their inactivation. An activating mutation of BRAF is frequently associated with 
      this phenotype. As described above, CRC shows genetic heterogeneity, however the 
      consequences in terms of signalling pathway alterations are similar. For example, 
      the activation of Wnt signalling pathways can result from the inactivation of the 
      APC gene in the CIN phenotype or from an activating mutation in the β-catenin gene 
      in MSI tumors. The inactivation of TGFβ pathways is also present in both tumor types 
      and is driven by SMAD4, and more rarely by a SMAD2 inactivating mutation in CIN 
      tumors, or by the existence of a frame-shift mutation occurring in a polyG coding 
      track of the TGFβ (transforming growth factor) receptor type II in MSI tumors. The 
      RAS-MAP kinase pathway is activated by KRAS mutations in CIN tumors or by BRAF 
      mutations in MSI tumors. The p53 pathway is inactivated by TP53 inactivation in CIN 
      tumors or by BAX inactivating mutations in MSI tumors.

AB  - Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) is a rare, chronic B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder 
      characterized by distinctive morphologic features and an indolent clinical course. 
      The discovery of a recurrent activating mutation in BRAF (BRAF V600E) as a 
      disease-defining genetic event in HCL has substantial diagnostic and therapeutic 
      implications. Areas covered: Herein the authors review the role of BRAF V600E and 
      RAF-MEK-ERK signaling in the pathogenesis of HCL, anecdotal clinical reports of BRAF 
      inhibitor monotherapy in management of relapsed or refractory HCL, larger phase 2 
      trials investigating efficacy of BRAF inhibitor therapy for HCL, adverse effects 
      commonly associated with BRAF inhibitor therapy, including cutaneous toxicity, and 
      mechanisms of therapeutic resistance. Expert opinion: Ongoing and planned studies 
      will help to optimize the use of BRAF inhibitor therapy for HCL by determining the 
      efficacy of BRAF inhibition in combination with other antigen targeted or 
      molecularly targeted therapies, and more broadly, to determine how hematologists can 
      best utilize and sequence emerging diagnostic and therapeutic modalities in the care 
      of patients with newly diagnosed and relapsed or refractory HCL.

AB  - In 1951 William Dameshek classified polycythemia vera (PV), essential thombocytosis 
      (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) as pathogenetically related myeloproliferative 
      disorders (MPD). Subsequent studies demonstrated that PV, ET, and PMF are clonal 
      disorders of multipotent hematopoietic progenitors. In 2005, a somatic activating 
      mutation in the JAK2 nonreceptor tyrosine kinase (JAK2V617F) was identified in most 
      patients with PV and in a significant proportion of patients with ET and PMF. 
      Subsequent studies identified additional mutations in the JAK-STAT pathway in some 
      patients with JAK2V617F(-) MPD, suggesting that constitutive activation of this 
      signaling pathway is a unifying feature of these disorders. Although the discovery 
      of mutations in the JAK-STAT pathway is important from a pathogenetic and diagnostic 
      perspective, important questions remain regarding the role of this single disease 
      allele in 3 related but clinically distinct disorders, and the role of additional 
      genetic events in MPD disease pathogenesis. In addition, these observations provide 
      a foundation for development of small molecule inhibitors of JAK2 that are currently 
      being tested in clinical trials. This review will discuss our understanding of the 
      pathogenesis of PV, ET, and PMF, the potential role of JAK2-targeted therapy, and 
      the important unanswered questions that need to be addressed to improve clinical 
      outcome.

AB  - Afatinib (BIBW 2992) is an irreversible multi-target HER receptor tyrosine kinase 
      inhibitor developed in patients with advanced solid tumours. Several phase I studies 
      were conducted in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), as a single 
      agent or in combination. In further phase II or III studies, patients were selected 
      based on the duration of response to first generation EGFR-TKI in previous line 
      (supposed to have greater chance to have an activating EGFR mutation) or based 
      directly on the EGFR activating mutation status. Here, we report and comment the 
      main results of these studies in lung cancer patients. This drug has been approved 
      by the Food and Drug Administration in June 2013 for the first-line treatment of 
      patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumours have EGFR mutation. In Europe, it has 
      been approved in September 2013 in the same indication.

AB  - Acquired inhibitors of coagulation cause a life-threatening disease. Clinically 
      newly occurring hemorrhagic diathesis combined with prolonged activated partial 
      thromboplastin time (aPTT) time is diagnostically indicative and can be confirmed by 
      a positive plasma exchange test. For thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and 
      hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP-HUS) the diagnosis of Coombs negative hemolytic 
      anemia together with thrombocytopenia should lead to the detection of fragmentocytes 
      in peripheral blood smears. Hairy cell leukemia is a rare subgroup of chronic B-cell 
      neoplasia with the clinical signs of pancytopenia and splenomegaly which 
      characteristically stain positive for CD103. The gastrointestinal stromal tumor 
      (GIST) has nothing in common with classical soft tissue sarcoma based on the 
      activating mutation of the KIT or PDGFRA gene (positivity for CD117). In all of 
      these disorders the correct diagnosis has a major influence on patient outcome. For 
      the case of acquired inhibitors of coagulation immunosuppressive therapy and 
      substitution of coagulation factors (e.g. recombinant factor VIIa) or for TTP-HUS 
      the immediate start of plasma exchange are mandatory. For hairy cell leukemia a very 
      effective treatment exists with purine analogs (e.g. cladribine) and for metastatic 
      inoperable GIST with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (e.g. imatinib).

AB  - Mutations in the BRAF oncogene are found in 2-4% of all non-small cell lung cancer 
      (NSCLC) patients. The most common activating mutation present within the BRAF 
      oncogene is associated with valine substitution for glutamate at position 600 
      (V600E) within the BRAF kinase. BRAF-targeted therapies are effective in patients 
      with melanoma and NSCLC harboring BRAF V600E mutation. In both melanoma and NSCLC, 
      dual inhibition of both BRAF and the downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase 
      (MEK) improves response rates compared with BRAF inhibition alone. BRAF-MEK 
      combination therapy (dabrafenib plus trametinib) demonstrated tolerability and 
      efficacy in a recent phase II clinical trial and was approved by the European 
      Medicines Agency and United States Food and Drug Administration for patients with 
      stage IV NSCLC harboring BRAF V600E mutation. Here, in this review, we outline the 
      preclinical and clinical data for BRAF and MEK inhibitor combination treatment for 
      NSCLC patients with BRAF V600E mutation.

AB  - Activating mutation of KRAS plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of common 
      human malignancies and molecular testing of KRAS mutation has emerged as an 
      essential biomarker in the current practice of clinical oncology. The presence of 
      KRAS mutation is generally associated with clinical aggressiveness of the cancer and 
      reduced survival of the patient. Therapeutically, KRAS mutation testing has maximum 
      utility in stratifying metastatic colorectal carcinoma and lung cancer patients for 
      treatment with targeted therapy. Diagnostically, KRAS mutation testing is useful in 
      the workup of pancreaticobiliary and thyroid cancers, particularly using cytological 
      specimens. In the era of precision medicine, the role of KRAS mutation testing is 
      poised to expand, likely in a setting of combinatorial therapeutic strategy and 
      requiring additional mutation testing of its upstream and/or downstream effectors.

PG  - 1002-1010
LID - 10.1200/JCO.2016.71.1556 [doi]
AB  - Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) is a chronic mature B-cell neoplasm with unique 
      clinicopathologic features and an initial exquisite sensitivity to chemotherapy with 
      purine analogs; however, the disease relapses, often repeatedly. The enigmatic 
      pathogenesis of HCL was recently clarified by the discovery of its underlying 
      genetic cause, the BRAF-V600E kinase-activating mutation, which is somatically and 
      clonally present in almost all patients through the entire disease spectrum and 
      clinical course. By aberrantly activating the RAF-MEK-ERK signaling pathway, 
      BRAF-V600E shapes key biologic features of HCL, including its specific expression 
      signature, hairy morphology, and antiapoptotic behavior. Accompanying mutations of 
      the KLF2 transcription factor or the CDKN1B/p27 cell cycle inhibitor are recurrent 
      in 16% of patients with HCL and likely cooperate with BRAF-V600E in HCL 
      pathogenesis. Conversely, BRAF-V600E is absent in other B-cell neoplasms, including 
      mimickers of HCL that require different treatments (eg, HCL-variant and splenic 
      marginal zone lymphoma). Thus, testing for BRAF-V600E allows for a genetics-based 
      differential diagnosis between HCL and HCL-like tumors, even noninvasively in 
      routine blood samples. BRAF-V600E also represents a new therapeutic target. 
      Patients' leukemic cells exposed ex vivo to BRAF inhibitors are spoiled of their HCL 
      identity and then undergo apoptosis. In clinical trials of patients with HCL who 
      have experienced multiple relapses after purine analogs or who are refractory to 
      purine analogs, a short course of the oral BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib produced an 
      almost 100% response rate, including complete remission rates of 35% to 42%, without 
      myelotoxicity. To further improve on these results, it will be important to clarify 
      the mechanisms of incomplete leukemic cell eradication by vemurafenib and to explore 
      chemotherapy-free combinations of a BRAF inhibitor with other targeted agents (eg, a 
      MEK inhibitor and/or an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody).

AB  - In a compatible clinico-radiological setting, the diagnosis of Erdheim-Chester 
      disease (ECD) involves the analysis of histiocytes in tissue biopsies: they are 
      typically foamy and CD68+ CD1a, whereas in Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) they 
      are CD68+ CD1a+. Overlap forms of histiocytoses are frequent. Technetium bone 
      scintigraphy showing nearly constant tracer uptake by the long bones is highly 
      suggestive of ECD and a 'hairy kidney' appearance on abdominal CT scan is observed 
      in more than half ECD cases. CNS involvement is a strong prognostic factor and an 
      independent predictor of death in cases of ECD. Optimal initial therapy for ECD 
      appears to be administration of IFN-α (and/or pegylated IFN-α) and prolonged 
      treatment significantly improves survival; however, tolerance may be poor. Best 
      alternative therapies are anakinra, mainly effective for mild forms of the disease, 
      infliximab, and sirolimus. Cases of ECD present with strong systemic immune 
      activation, involving IFN-α, IL-1/IL1-RA, IL-6, IL-12, and MCP-1, consistent with 
      the systemic immune Th-1-oriented disturbance associated with the disease. Between 
      57 and 75 % of ECD patients carry the BRAF(V600E) mutation, an activating mutation 
      of the proto-oncogene BRAF. More than 50 cases harboring BRAF mutation and with 
      severe multisystemic and refractory ECD (sometimes associated with LCH) have been 
      treated worldwide with vemurafenib, a BRAF inhibitor that proved to be very 
      beneficial. Other recurrent mutations of the MAPK (NRAS, MAP2K1) and PIK3 pathways 
      (PIK3CA) have been found among ECD patients. As recurrent mutations in the MAPK 
      pathway are found in ECD and LCH on a background of chronic inflammation, we believe 
      that both conditions should be redefined as an inflammatory myeloid neoplasia.

AB  - Oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) is a robust and sustained antiproliferative 
      response brought about by oncogenic signaling resulting from an activating mutation 
      of an oncogene, or the inactivation of a tumor-suppressor gene. The pathways 
      mediating OIS are complex and incompletely elucidated but, the proliferative arrest 
      involves activation of both the RB and p53 pathways. In addition, whereas there are 
      indications that at least in some situations, negative feedback loops abolish the 
      increased mitogenic signaling resulting from the oncogenic mutations, also an 
      unexpected contribution of interleukin-mediated signaling has recently been found. 
      OIS brings about cessation of growth of some benign tumors, including melanocytic 
      nevi and several other lesions, including pituitary and thyroid adenomas. It 
      protects against progression to cancer, and in this way complements oncogene-induced 
      apoptosis. Perhaps, OIS has evolved as an alternative to apoptosis especially 
      regarding long-lived cell types that are not replaceable in large numbers. Contrary 
      to the earlier belief, OIS is not entirely irreversible, at least in some well 
      documented in vitro systems. This means that its induction does not entirely 
      eliminate the oncogenic threat resulting from the mutated cell. It also means that 
      OIS, or related phenomena that may affect a proportion of the tumor cells of some 
      cancers, may have an influence on responsiveness to cytotoxic cancer therapies, 
      because OIS is associated with an antiapoptosis phenotype.

AB  - Mastocytosis (MC) encompasses a range of disorders characterized by a clonal, 
      pathological accumulation of mast cells having a somatic activating mutation of the 
      tyrosine kinase receptor Kit (exon 17, codon 816; D816V) in more than 90 % of adult 
      patients. The mutation is much less common in children. Skin and bone marrow are 
      most often affected. Symptoms and clinical course are very heterogeneous due to a 
      variable degree of local or systemic mediator release or organ dysfunction as a 
      result of mast cell infiltrates. Pruritus, wheals, flushing and gastrointestinal 
      symptoms are often reported. The majority of pediatric patients experience 
      spontaneous remission of MC. Adults usually have chronic disease, rarely 
      transforming into an aggressive or lethal type. Indolent systemic MC with 
      involvement of skin and bone is the most common type. In MC the risk for 
      anaphylactic reactions following an insect sting (and other causes of mast cell 
      activation) is increased significantly. Diagnostic hallmarks are biopsies from skin 
      and bone marrow using tryptase antibodies for staining as well as serum tryptase 
      levels. At present a curative treatment for MC is not available. Systemic histamine 
      H(1) receptor antagonists are widely used. Aggressive types of MC respond partially 
      to IFN-alpha or cladribine. A variety of receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors is 
      still under critical evaluation for systemic treatment of MC. After introduction of 
      the WHO classification for MC and the development a German MC guideline, as well as 
      the foundation of national and international competence networks for MC, a 
      significantly improved quality of medical care for MC patients can be expected for 
      the future.

AB  - Mastocytosis is a rare, almost exclusively sporadically occurring disease involving 
      an increase in clonal tissue mast cells. The disease spectrum is heterogenous, 
      ranging from isolated skin lesions with a normal life expectancy to rare, aggressive 
      forms with very poor prognosis. Children are often affected. But whereas these 
      almost invariantly display solely a cutaneous mastocytosis with polymorphous skin 
      lesions, in adults the lesions are small and maculopapular and in over 80% of cases 
      accompanied by involvement of bone marrow and the D816V activating mutation of the 
      gene for the c‑Kit receptor. There are many symptoms for the disease. Patients 
      suffer frequently from pruritus, diarrhea, abdominal cramp, palpitations and flush. 
      Osteoporosis is often present, with osteolysis with pathological fractures 
      frequently involved in more aggressive forms. Patients are especially at risk to 
      severe anaphylaxis caused by hymenoptera stings. Therapy is symptomatic, with 
      cytoreductive therapy reserved for resistant and aggressive forms.

AB  - A subgroup of androgen receptor-expressing tumors represents approximately 30 % of 
      all triple negative tumors. The androgen receptor and its signaling pathways have a 
      central biological role in this tumor entity. These triple negative androgen 
      receptor-positive tumors occur in older patients and do not appear to have a better 
      prognosis compared to other triple negative tumors. In addition to androgen 
      receptor-expression, these tumors are genomically characterized by a high frequency 
      of PIK3CA activating mutation. Three clinical trials reported efficacy data for 
      anti-androgens (bicalutamide, abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide) based on strong 
      preclinical rationale. These trials report clinical benefit rates in about one in 
      five patients. These encouraging but still limited results make a case for the 
      identification of predictive response factors and therapeutic combinations to 
      improve response rates. This review will provide an update on the biological and 
      clinical knowledge of this tumoral subgroup that opens the way to non-cytotoxic 
      anti-androgen therapies.

TI  - Epidermal growth factor receptor-activating mutation(E746_T751>VP) in pancreatic 
      ductal adenocarcinoma responds to erlotinib, followed by epidermal growth factor 
      receptor resistance-mediating mutation (A647T): A case report and literature review.
PG  - 950-954
LID - 10.4103/jcrt.JCRT_729_18 [doi]
AB  - Despite recent advances in treatment with multidrug chemotherapy regimens, outcomes 
      of patients with advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remain very poor. 
      Treatment with targeted therapies has shown marginal benefits due to intrinsic or 
      acquired resistance. Actionable mutations, while detected infrequently in patients 
      with PDAC, are becoming increasingly used in personalized medicine. Here, we 
      describe an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-activating mutation 
      (E746_T751>VP) to erlotinib, a first-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), in 
      a patient with metastatic PDAC. After an initial partial response to erlotinib for 
      12 months, the patient's disease progressed with emergence of the EGFR A647T 
      mutation. Certainly, the patient also progressed after switching therapy to a 
      third-generation EGFR TKI (osimertinib). This case illustrates the posttreatment 
      evolution of EGFR A647T-mediated resistance to the first- and third-generation TKIs. 
      To our knowledge, this is the first case to report the aforementioned activating and 
      resistance-mediated mutations. In summary, genomic analysis performed in this 
      patient with PDAC on the tumor biopsy and peripheral blood provided tools to 
      understand mechanisms of response and resistance to targeted therapy with EFGR TKIs.

TI  - BRAF mutation testing in clinical practice.
PG  - 127-38
LID - 10.1586/erm.12.1 [doi]
AB  - Serine/threonine-protein kinase BRAF, a downstream effector of the RAS oncogene 
      along the MEK/ERK signaling pathway, has emerged as an important biological marker 
      for diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic guidance for human cancers. The high 
      prevalence of BRAF(V600E) activating mutation in papillary thyroid carcinoma, 
      cutaneous malignant melanoma and hairy cell leukemia implies that the mutation is an 
      important 'driver' or 'codriver' in the development of a subset of these cancers. 
      Diagnostically, the BRAF(V600E) mutation is a powerful molecular marker for 
      papillary thyroid carcinoma and, quite possibly, hairy cell leukemia as well. 
      Cancers with a BRAF mutation are generally more aggressive than their counterparts 
      without the mutation. Importantly, mutant BRAF has been a highly attractive target 
      for precision cancer therapy. Indeed, recent studies in the clinical trials of BRAF 
      inhibitors in patients with malignant melanoma are changing the treatment paradigm 
      of this highly lethal disease. BRAF mutation testing using highly sensitive and 
      specific methodology in a molecular diagnostic laboratory is essential in the 
      current clinical practice of oncology.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Metastatic melanoma is an aggressive disease resistant to 
      chemotherapy. Recent clinical trials have reported improved survival for two novel 
      agents; ipilimumab, a humanized, IgG1 monoclonal antibody that blocks cytotoxic 
      T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and vemurafenib , a BRAF (v-raf murine 
      sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1) inhibitor targeting an activating mutation in the 
      serine-threonine-protein kinase BRAF gene. AREAS COVERED: The authors reviewed 
      preclinical and clinical data examining the safety of vemurafenib in melanoma. 
      MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched using the medical subject heading 'vemurafenib' and 
      the following text terms: melanoma, BRAF inhibition, vemurafenib. This review 
      provides the reader with an overview of current data examining the efficacy and 
      safety of vemurafenib in metastatic melanoma. EXPERT OPINION: Vemurafenib is an oral 
      agent licensed for patients with BRAF V600E mutation-positive inoperable and 
      metastatic melanoma. The most common adverse effects observed in Phase III clinical 
      trials were dermatological events, arthralgia and fatigue. Specific dermatological 
      toxicities included development of cutaneous squamous cell cancers and 
      keratoacanthomas. Prolongation of the QT interval was also reported. Regular 
      dermatological assessments and electrocardiograms are recommended. Ongoing trials 
      are examining vemurafenib in both the adjuvant setting and metastatic setting in 
      combination with ipilimumab and MEK inhibitors (mitogen-activated protein 
      kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase). Understanding and overcoming 
      mechanisms of resistance to BRAF inhibitors is the focus of ongoing research.

AB  - Introduction: Lung cancer is the most prevalent malignant tumors worldwide. Over the 
      past decade, the emergence of epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase 
      inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) has ushered in a new era of lung cancer treatment. Therefore, 
      clinical trials investigating the efficacy and safety of these drugs are 
      important.Areas covered: This review provides an overview on the safety of three 
      classes of EGFR-TKIs and discusses the adverse events (AEs) and reactions reported 
      in the literature.Expert opinion: EGFR-TKIs significantly improve progression-free 
      survival and overall survival in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with an 
      activating mutation of EGFR. However, EGFR-TKIs also block the EGFR-regulating 
      pathways in the skin and gastrointestinal tract and cause AEs, including diarrhea, 
      liver toxicity, skin disease, stomatitis, interstitial lung disease, and ocular 
      toxicity, which have detrimental effects on quality of life and drug compliance. 
      Clinicians should understand how to prevent and control these adverse reactions, 
      which can often be achieved by dose reduction, discontinuation of treatment, or 
      switching to another drug.

TI  - HEREDITARY PITUITARY TUMOR SYNDROMES: GENETIC AND CLINICAL ASPECTS.
PG  - 8-18
LID - 10.24875/RIC.19003186 [doi]
AB  - The pituitary gland is responsible for the synthesis and secretion of various 
      hormones that play a key role in regulating endocrine function and homeostasis. 
      Pituitary adenomas (PA) are benign epithelial tumors arising from the endocrine 
      cells of the anterior pituitary gland. Clinically relevant PA are relatively common 
      and they occur in 0.1% of the general population. They are mostly benign monoclonal 
      neoplasms that arise from any of the five hormone-secreting cell types of the 
      anterior pituitary gland. PA are categorized as either functioning or 
      non-functioning, depending on whether or not they produce a hormonal hypersecretion 
      syndrome. Both functioning and non-functioning adenomas can produce symptoms or 
      signs resulting from compression of the optic chiasm or invasion of cavernous 
      sinuses. Only 5% of PA occur within the context of hereditary syndromes with 
      reasonably well-defined oncogenic mechanisms. The vast majority of PA are sporadic, 
      and their etiopathogenesis remains largely unknown. Pituitary tumor oncogenesis 
      involves several mechanisms that eventually lead to abnormal cell proliferation and 
      dysregulated hormone production. Among these factors, we found inactivating 
      mutations of tumor suppressor genes, activating mutation of oncogenes and the 
      participation of hormonal signals coming from the hypothalamus, all resulting in 
      cell-cycle regulation abnormalities. In this review, we summarize the clinical and 
      pathophysiological aspects of the different hereditary pituitary tumor syndromes.

TI  - Genetics and genomics of ovarian sex cord-stromal tumors.
PG  - 285-291
LID - 10.1111/cge.12917 [doi]
AB  - Ovarian sex cord-stromal tumors (SCST) represent approximately 8% of malignant 
      ovarian tumors. The most common are granulosa cell tumors (GCT) which account for 
      approximately 90% of malignant SCST. Recent studies have unraveled the key genomic 
      and genetic events contributing to their pathogenesis. SCST are found in the 
      hereditary syndromes: Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, Ollier disease and Maffucci syndrome, 
      and DICER1 syndrome. Genomic studies have largely been limited to GCT where a number 
      of recurring chromosomal abnormalities (monsomy and trisomy) have been identified 
      although their contribution to pathogenesis remains unclear. In addition to the 
      recurrent DICER1 mutations reported in non-hereditary cases of Sertoli cell and 
      Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors, recurrent somatic mutations in both the juvenile (j) and 
      adult (a) forms of GCT have been reported. Approximately 30% of jGCT contain a 
      somatic mutation, the gsp oncogene, while a further 60% have an activating mutation 
      in the AKT gene. In the case of aGCT, a well characterized mutation in the FOXL2 
      transcription factor (FOXL2 C134W) is found in almost all cases, which arguably 
      defines the disease, although the molecular events that determine the stage, 
      behavior and prognosis of aGCT remain to be determined.

AB  - Constitutively activating mutations in the TSH receptor gene have been found in 
      various disorders. Somatic mutations were identified in autonomously functioning 
      thyroid nodules(AFTNs) and toxic multinodular goiters(TMNGs). Germline mutations 
      were identified in autosomal dominantly inherited non-autoimmune hyperthyroidism and 
      sporadic congenital hyperthyroidism. Most of activating TSH receptor mutations were 
      identified in western countries. Only one Japanese family has been reported to have 
      an activating TSH receptor mutation. Previous very poor and insensitive study 
      identified no somatic TSH receptor activating mutations in 45 AFTNs and TMNGs 
      developed in Japanese. Our recent study completely reversed their observation; about 
      half of AFTNs in Japanese had activating mutations.

TI  - Metastatic Lung Cancer: Emerging Therapeutic Strategies.
PG  - 736-749
AB  - Advanced stage nonsmall cell lung cancer had been treated mainly with platinum-based 
      doublet chemotherapy, and other cytotoxic agents that offered significant survival 
      advantage over best supportive care, until recently. Modest improvements were 
      achieved with the addition of antibodies targeting the vascular endothelial growth 
      factor, and the introduction of maintenance chemotherapy. Improvements in our 
      knowledge of lung cancer biology have shifted the current treatment paradigm from 
      being based on histology to one based on molecular biomarkers. Identification of 
      potentially targetable driver mutations in a subgroup of these patients, pertaining 
      to genes directing cell signaling pathways involved in proliferation and survival, 
      has been the single most influential development in the treatment of lung cancer in 
      the last two decades. Personalized medicine based on driver mutations offers 
      enhanced efficacy at the expense of relatively minimal toxicity burden. Targeting 
      the epidermal growth factor receptor pathway in patients with an activating mutation 
      results in substantial improvement in patient outcome. Similarly, targeting ALK 
      (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) fusion gene with first- and second-generation 
      inhibitors results in improved efficacy over chemotherapy. For certain other 
      mutations such as MET exon 14 and BRAF, promising inhibitory strategies are being 
      investigated. In addition, the recent emergence of immune checkpoint inhibitors to 
      reverse exhaustion of T cells has been a major breakthrough in rapidly changing the 
      therapeutic landscape for lung cancer. This article reviews the role of systemic 
      therapy in advanced stage lung cancer.

LID - 10.2217/fon.15.250 [doi]
AB  - Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients whose tumors have an EGFR-activating 
      mutation develop acquired resistance after a median of 9-11 months from the 
      beginning of treatment with erlotinib, gefitinib and afatinib. T790M mutation is the 
      cause of this resistance in approximately 60% of cases. AZD9291 is an oral, 
      irreversible, mutant-selective EGF receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) 
      developed to have potency against EGFR mutations, including T790M mutation, while 
      sparing wild-type EGFR. A Phase I trial of AZD9291 in EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients, 
      demonstrated high activity, essentially among T790M-mutant tumors, with a manageable 
      tolerability profile. Ongoing Phase III trials are evaluating AZD9291 in EGFR-mutant 
      patients as first-line treatment compared with erlotinib and gefitinib; and as 
      second-line treatment compared with chemotherapy after progression on EGFR TKI in 
      T790M-mutant tumors. Better identification of T790M-mutant tumors post EGFR TKI 
      relapse and mechanisms of resistance to AZD9291 are the future challenges. This 
      article reviews the emerging data regarding AZD9291 in the treatment of patients 
      with advanced NSCLC.

AB  - Multiple mutations in the EGFR gene are a major cause for the failure of Erlotinib 
      and Gefitinib in the treatment of patients harboring non-small-cell lung cancer 
      (NSCLC) who initially responded to this therapy. The development of these tyrosine 
      kinase inhibitors (TKIs) is going back to the early 90s, where cancer was widely 
      considered and fully treated as a disease of an organ. Fundamental gain of knowledge 
      in cell biology in general and cancer genetics in particular led us to where we 
      currently stand: cancer is a disease that originates in the genome. Fast and 
      affordable gene sequencing paved the way and opened our eyes for the genetic 
      instability of many cancers, particularly EGFR driven NSCLC. This might allow highly 
      rational and personal therapies by aiming at a very particular wild type and mutant 
      kinase pattern. However, the paradigm "one disease - one target - one drug" is 
      currently challenged. Both activating and deactivating EGFR mutations are known to 
      render the development of novel targeted drugs difficult. Among all lung 
      adenocarcinomas, only 20% are driven by EGFR and only a subpopulation has an 
      activating mutation (e.g. L858R), making them sensitive to first generation EGFR 
      inhibitors. Unfortunately, most of them acquire second deactivating mutations (e.g. 
      T790M) during treatment, leading to a complete loss of response. Are specific 
      inhibitors of the double EGFR mutant L858R/T790M the magic bullet? Much scientific 
      evidence but also high expectations justify this approach. Structural biology of 
      EGFR mutants constitutes the basis for highly rational approaches. Second generation 
      pan EGFR inhibitors inhibiting wild type (WT) and mutant EGFR like Afatinib suffer 
      from dose-limiting adverse effects. Inhibition of WT EGFR is considered to be the 
      culprit. Third generation EGFR inhibitors follow two strategies. Mutant selectivity 
      and improved target residential time. These inhibitors display high mutant 
      selectivity and irreversible binding patterns while sparing WT EGFR activity, hence 
      enhancing tumor selectivity while minimizing adverse effects. Third generation EGFR 
      inhibitors are still undergoing preclinical and clinical evaluation. The most 
      advanced are Rociletinib and AZD9291 which displayed encouraging preliminary 
      clinical phase II data regarding response and adverse effects. In the current review 
      we show both a medicinal chemists' approach toward the design of third generation 
      EGFR inhibitors as well as a detailed overview of the development of EGFR inhibitors 
      over the last decade. High interdisciplinary approaches, such as structural biology 
      and time-resolved tumor genetics pave the way toward the development of drugs that 
      target EGFR mutants. This might lead to highly effective targeted and personalized 
      therapies with enhanced response rates for a minor cohort of patients which have to 
      undergo continuous gene sequencing, hence enabling therapies with tailor-made TKIs.

TI  - Gastrointestinal stromal tumors--a review.
PG  - 62-71
AB  - Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) may be defined as intraabdominal 
      nonepithelial (mesenchymal) tumors that express the KIT protein or have an 
      activating mutation in a class III receptor tyrosine kinase gene (KIT or PDGFRA). 
      GISTs are diagnosed at a frequency of about 15 new cases annually per million, 
      though small indolent GISTs are likely to occur more frequently in the general 
      population. The clinical behavior is variable, and assessment of the malignancy 
      potential is usually based mainly on the size and the proliferation characteristics 
      of the tumor. The overwhelming majority of GISTs express the KIT protein, the 
      transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase for the stem cell factor. The majority of 
      GISTs harbor a mutation in the KIT proto-oncogene that translates into 
      constitutively activated KIT protein kinase, and a minority have mutated PDGFRA gene 
      resulting in activated platelet-derived growth factor alpha receptor tyrosine 
      kinase. Most GISTs respond to imatinib mesylate, which selectively inhibits both KIT 
      and PDGFRA, and is now considered as the standard systemic therapy for advanced 
      GIST. In contrast, responses to conventional chemotherapy are infrequent (generally 
      less than 10%), but combination therapies with imatinib have not been explored. 
      Research on adjuvant imatinib and novel targeted therapies is ongoing.

TI  - Activating BRAF mutation in sclerosing mucoepidermoid carcinoma with eosinophilia of 
      the thyroid gland: two case reports and review of the literature.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sclerosing mucoepidermoid carcinoma with eosinophilia is a rare form of 
      thyroid carcinoma. The underlying molecular mechanisms of sclerosing mucoepidermoid 
      carcinoma with eosinophilia tumorigenesis remain unknown. CASE PRESENTATION: We 
      present two cases of sclerosing mucoepidermoid carcinoma with eosinophilia, both 
      with a concurrent papillary thyroid carcinoma. Patient 1, a 70-year-old Caucasian 
      woman, presented with sclerosing mucoepidermoid carcinoma with eosinophilia with 
      distant renal metastasis and coexisting papillary thyroid carcinoma. Patient 2, a 
      74-year-old Caucasian woman with a remote history of thyroid cancer treated with 
      thyroidectomy, presented with locoregionally invasive sclerosing mucoepidermoid 
      carcinoma with eosinophilia and recurrent papillary thyroid carcinoma in the thyroid 
      bed. BRAF mutation studies were performed on the sclerosing mucoepidermoid carcinoma 
      with eosinophilia tumors. In both cases, sclerosing mucoepidermoid carcinoma with 
      eosinophilia was positive for the BRAF V600E mutation by polymerase chain reaction. 
      Patient 1 is the first reported case of sclerosing mucoepidermoid carcinoma with 
      eosinophilia with renal metastasis, to the best of our knowledge. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      findings suggest, for the first time, to our knowledge, involvement of the 
      RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling pathway in the pathogenesis of sclerosing mucoepidermoid 
      carcinoma with eosinophilia. Thus, BRAF inhibitors may prove to be a useful targeted 
      medical therapy in the treatment of a subset of patients with aggressive sclerosing 
      mucoepidermoid carcinoma with eosinophilia tumors who exhibit BRAF activating 
      mutation.

AB  - The RAS protein controls signaling pathway are major player in cell growth, its 
      regulation and malignant transformation. Any activation in RAS brings alteration in 
      upstream or downstream signaling component. Activating mutation in RAS is found in 
      approximately 30% of human cancer. RAS plays essential role in tumor maintenance and 
      is therefore an appropriate target for anticancer therapy. Among the anti-RAS 
      strategies that are under evaluation in the clinic are pharmacologic inhibitors 
      designed to prevent: (1) association with the plasma membrane (prenylation and post 
      prenylation inhibitors). (2) Downstream signaling (kinase inhibitor), (3) upstream 
      pathway (kinase inhibitor and monoclonal antibody), (4) Expression of RAS or other 
      component of pathway (siRNA and antisense oligonucleotide). Several of these new 
      therapeutic agents are showing promising result in the clinic and many more are on 
      the way. Here, we review the current status and new hopes for targeting RAS as an 
      anticancer drug.

AB  - Myeloproliferative neoplasms (chronic myeloproliferative disorders according to 
      former nomenclature) comprise chronic myeloid leukemia, polycythemia vera, essential 
      thrombocythemia, primary myelofibrosis, chronic eosinophilic leukemia, chronic 
      neutrophilic leukemia and systemic mastocytosis. All disorders have excessive 
      proliferation of one or more hematopoietic lineages in common and progress with 
      different probability to blast crisis or fibrosis. A further common feature is 
      provided by the activating mutation of tyrosin kinases and associated pathways of 
      signal transduction (BCR-ABL, JAK2(V617F), MPL(W515L/K), KIT(D816V) and 
      FIP1L1-PDGFRA) causative for the abnormal proliferation. With regard to diagnosis 
      and therapy these mutations are of utmost importance because they enable the 
      exclusion of reactive processes, contribute with varying specificity to subtyping of 
      MPN and are at least partly sensitive to targeted therapy. The molecular mechanisms 
      of blastic and fibrotic progression are not yet understood.

AB  - Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are a set of very heterogeneous tumors with numerous 
      histological categories. The development of the molecular biology allowed 
      identifying recurring molecular anomalies in certain subgroups of sarcomas, being 
      able to represent diagnostic, prognosis and therapeutic tools. The molecular 
      classification of STS includes until today 5 main groups of abnormalities: sarcomas 
      with "simple genomic profile" showing reciprocal (1) chromosomal translocations, (2) 
      activating mutation, (3) inhibitive mutation or (4) simple amplification; (5) 
      sarcomas with "complex genomic profile" can include several tens of molecular 
      abnormalities. The development of new-targeted therapies is based on the 
      identification of a target, specific of a tumors subgroup and involved in 
      carcinogenesis mechanisms and/or tumoral growth. Then, the aim of clinical research 
      is to establish the proof of the concept through clinical trials, demonstrating the 
      benefit brought to the patient and ending in the marketing of the drug. This proof 
      of the concept was clearly established for imatinib, sunitinib and regorafenib in 
      gastrointestinal stromal tumors, for imatinib in dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans and 
      pigmented vilo-nodular synovitis, for denosumab in giant cell tumors of the bone, 
      ending in the authorization to use these new therapies in these indications. It is 
      in progress and promising for anti-IGF-1R in Ewing sarcomas, for crizotinib in 
      myofibroblastic inflammatory tumors, for mTOR inhibitor in PEComas... The role of 
      molecular abnormalities identified in the mechanisms of tumoral progress for 
      sarcomas and their potential therapeutic impact will be detailed.

AB  - Human melanoma represents the fastest growing malignancy in the US. The etiology of 
      melanoma is highly debated as is the role of ultraviolet (UV) radiation in the 
      initiation and progression of melanoma. This article discusses data from UV exposure 
      and its relationship to the development of melanoma from various models of melanoma 
      as well as various genetic alterations seen in oncogenic transformation of 
      melanocytes. Genetic alterations such as the p16(INK4a) deletion, melanocortin 1 
      receptor (MC1R), RAS, and v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF) may 
      be indicative of a predisposition to melanoma development. Historical research as 
      well as current data on the significance of the hot spot mutation in BRAF is 
      discussed in its relative potential to the activating mutation in RAS.

TI  - Emerging importance of ALK in neuroblastoma.
PG  - 267-75
LID - 10.1016/j.semcancer.2011.09.005 [doi]
AB  - Since the original descriptions of gain-of function mutations in anaplastic lymphoma 
      kinase (ALK), interest in the role of this receptor tyrosine kinase in neuroblastoma 
      development and as a potential therapeutic target has escalated. As a group, the 
      activating point mutations in full-length ALK, found in approximately 8% of all 
      neuroblastoma tumors, are distributed evenly across different clinical stages. 
      However, the most frequent somatic mutation, F1174L, is associated with 
      amplification of the MYCN oncogene. This combination of features appears to confer a 
      worse prognosis than MYCN amplification alone, suggesting a cooperative effect on 
      neuroblastoma formation by these two proteins. Indeed, F1174L has shown more potent 
      transforming activity in vivo than the second most common activating mutation, 
      R1275Q, and is responsible for innate and acquired resistance to crizotinib, a 
      clinically relevant ALK inhibitor that will soon be commercially available. These 
      advances cast ALK as a bona fide oncoprotein in neuroblastoma and emphasize the need 
      to understand ALK-mediated signaling in this tumor. This review addresses many of 
      the current issues surrounding the role of ALK in normal development and 
      neuroblastoma pathogenesis, and discusses the prospects for clinically effective 
      targeted treatments based on ALK inhibition.

AB  - Thyroid carcinoma is the most common endocrine malignancy, and although the disease 
      generally has an excellent prognosis, therapeutic options are limited for patients 
      not cured by surgery and radioiodine. Thyroid carcinomas commonly contain one of a 
      small number of recurrent genetic mutations. The identification and study of these 
      mutations has led to a deeper understanding of the pathophysiology of this disease 
      and is providing new approaches to diagnosis and therapy. Papillary thyroid 
      carcinomas usually contain an activating mutation in the RAS cascade, most commonly 
      in BRAF and less commonly in RAS itself or through gene fusions that activate RET. A 
      chromosomal translocation that results in production of a PAX8-PPARG fusion protein 
      is found in follicular carcinomas. Anaplastic carcinomas may contain some of the 
      above changes as well as additional mutations. Therapies that are targeted to these 
      mutations are being used in patient care and clinical trials.

TI  - Detection of BRAF V600E activating mutation in papillary thyroid carcinoma using PCR 
      with allele-specific fluorescent probe melting curve analysis.
PG  - 1211-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: A single hotspot mutation at nucleotide 1799 of the BRAF gene has been 
      identified as the most common genetic event in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), 
      with a prevalence of 29-83%. AIMS: To use a PCR assay to molecularly characterise 
      the BRAF activating point mutation in a series of PTC and benign thyroid cases and 
      correlate the mutation results with histological findings. METHODS: Formalin-fixed 
      paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sections were evaluated for the BRAF V600E mutation using 
      LightCycler PCR with allele-specific fluorescent probe melting curve analysis 
      (LCPCR). RESULTS: 42 (37 PTC; 5 benign) surgical tissue samples were analysed for 
      the BRAF V600E activating point mutation. Using LCPCR and direct DNA sequencing, the 
      BRAF mutation was identified in 23/37 (62.2%) PTC FFPE samples. DNA sequencing 
      results demonstrated confirmation of the mutation. CONCLUSIONS: Detection of 
      BRAF-activating mutations in PTC suggests new approaches to management and treatment 
      of this disease that may prove worthwhile. Identification of the BRAF V600E 
      activating mutation in routine FFPE pathology samples by a rapid laboratory method 
      such as LCPCR could have significant value.

AB  - Previously an increased frequency of KIT aberrations in mucosal melanomas was

      cases of metastatic melanoma and KIT-activating mutations have been published to be 
      successfully treated with c-KIT blockers such as imatinib, sunitinib, dasatinib or 
      sorafenib. We report here on one of our patients with KIT-activating mutation in 
      metastatic anal mucosal melanoma, who showed a response to imatinib therapy and 
      summarize the available literature regarding this new therapeutic option.

AB  - Systemic treatment of lung cancer patients with brain metastases is based on 
      clinical (presence of symptomatic intracranial lesions), pathological and molecular 
      characteristics of the disease. The efficacy of standard platinum-based chemotherapy 
      is comparable inside and outside the brain, justifying its use as front-line 
      therapy. The intracranial efficacy of targeted therapies (EGFR tyrosine kinase 
      inhibitors, ALK inhibitors) is demonstrated, and is globally superior to the 
      efficacy of standard chemotherapy, justifying their use as front-line therapy in 
      case of EGFR activating mutation or ALK rearrangement (providing the change in the 
      crizotinib label in France). The concomitant use of whole brain radiotherapy and a 
      systemic treatment (chemotherapy or targeted therapy) is not recommended in the 
      absence of a demonstrated better efficacy and/or acceptable safety profile. Several 
      trials are ongoing to assess new whole brain radiotherapy modalities, new targeted 
      therapies alone or in combination, especially exploring immunotherapy.

LID - 10.3748/wjg.v18.i20.2452 [doi]
AB  - Hyperplastic polyps have traditionally been considered not to have malignant 
      potential. New pathological classification of serrated polyps and recent discoveries 
      about the serrated pathway of carcinogenesis have revolutionized the concepts and 
      revitalized the research in this area. Until recently, it has been thought that most 
      colorectal cancers arise from conventional adenomas via the traditional tumor 
      suppressor pathway initiated by a mutation of the APC gene, but it has been found 
      that this pathway accounts for only approximately 70%-80% of colorectal cancer (CRC) 
      cases. The majority of the remaining colorectal cancer cases follow an alternative 
      pathway leading to CpG island methylator phenotype carcinoma with BRAF mutation and 
      with or without microsatellite instability. The mechanism of carcinomas arising from 
      this alternative pathway seems to begin with an activating mutation of the BRAF 
      oncogene. Serrated polyposis syndrome is a relatively rare condition characterized 
      by multiple and/or large serrated polyps of the colon. Clinical characteristics, 
      etiology and relationship of serrated polyposis syndrome to CRC have not been 
      clarified yet. Patients with this syndrome show a high risk of CRC and both sporadic 
      and hereditary cases have been described. Clinical criteria have been used for 
      diagnosis and frequent colonoscopy surveillance should be performed in order to 
      prevent colorectal cancer. In this review, we try to gather new insights into the 
      molecular pathogenesis of serrated polyps in order to understand their possible 
      clinical implications and to make an approach to the management of this syndrome.

TI  - Gastrointestinal stromal tumors.
PG  - 485-91
AB  - Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are mesenchymal gut tumors that differ 
      dramatically from other histologically similar neoplasms, such as leimomyomas, 
      leiomyosarcomas (LMS), and neural tumors. Complete surgical removal remains the best 
      current therapy for GISTs, but even major resections are associated with recurrence 
      in approximately 90% of cases. GISTs are remarkably resistant to irradiation and 
      standard chemotherapy; there is no role for treatment with those modalities. 
      Treatment of advanced GIST patients with STI571, a novel selective tyrosine kinase 
      inhibitor, results in remission rates that approach 60% and overall tumor control 
      rates of 85%. Selected groups of patients, as based on tumor mutational status, have 
      response rates as high as 80%. To date, STI571 therapy remains the only systemic 
      treatment for GISTs to have meaningful clinical activity. Though other molecularly 
      targeted therapies exist in oncology (eg, trastuzumab), STI571 is one of the first 
      that applies a drug specifically designed to inhibit the product of a 
      constitutively-activating mutation that drives pathogenesis of a solid tumor. Its 
      use can serve as a paradigm for designing molecularly targeted therapies for other 
      malignancies.

LID - 10.1684/bdc.2010.1213 [doi]
AB  - Sarcomas represent a heterogeneous group of tumors with a complex and poorly 
      reproducible classification. However, in the last ten years, several specific 
      genetic alterations have been described allowing a molecular classification with: 1) 
      sarcomas with a specific translocation which can be used as a diagnostic marker. 
      These translocations can be demonstrated by RT-PCR or by FISH with commercially 
      available break apart probes ; 2) sarcomas with simple genomic profile showing 
      amplification of a few genes. Well differentiated liposarcomas, dedifferentiated 
      liposarcomas and intimal sarcomas show a simple genomic profile characterised by 
      MDM2 and CDK4 amplifications associated with amplification of other genes in 
      dedifferentiated liposarcomas ; 3) sarcomas with activating mutations: about 90% of 
      GIST show activating mutation of a receptor tyrosine kinase gene, either KIT or 
      PDGFRA. The most frequent mutation involves exon 11 of KIT followed by exon 9 of KIT 
      and exon 18 of PDGFRA. Demonstration of these mutations is useful for the diagnosis 
      of CD117 negative GIST, for predicting response to imatinib and to explain secondary 
      resistance to imatinib ; 4) sarcomas with inactivating mutations: malignant rhabdoid 
      tumors show biallelic inactivation of INI1 gene with a lost of INI1 expression which 
      can be demonstrated by immunohistochemistry ; 5) other sarcomas usually show a 
      complex genomic profile characterised by numerous gains and losses of genes with a 
      frequent loss of RB1 and alterations of P53. Leiomyosarcomas, pleomorphic 
      rhabdomyosarcomas, pleomorphic liposarcomas, myxofibrosarcomas, poorly 
      differentiated sarcomas (so-called MFH and fibrosarcomas) belong to this category 
      and show no specific molecular abnormality.

AB  - Activating mutation in exons 19 or 21 of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in 
      non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLC) are associated with increased sensitivity to 
      EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs), such as gefitinib and erlotinib. Cancer 
      patients harboring activating EGFR mutations benefit from first-line TKI therapy. 
      Yet 10% of patients present a primary TKI resistance, while 50% of the others 
      develop a secondary resistance within 9-12 months after starting TKI. The RECIST's 
      definition of progression appears flawed when applied to EGFR-mutated NSCLC 
      patients. Most often, tumor volume shrinking widely exceeds 30% during TKI response 
      and kinetics of growth is low during relapse. At present, secondary resistance 
      mechanisms associated with progression are better known: clonal selection of EGFR 
      resistance mutation (T790M mutation in exon 20), amplification of transmembrane 
      receptors for other growth factors (c-met, HER family, IGF1R, or AXL), downstream 
      molecular alterations in EGFR signaling pathway (PI3K or PTEN), and 
      epithelial-mesenchymal transition or transdifferentiation to small-cell cancer. The 
      best strategy for secondary resistance is not well-defined: maintaining TKI therapy, 
      switching to chemotherapy, combining both treatments, or using new therapies 
      targeting other signaling pathways.

AB  - Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in women. A substantial fraction of 
      breast cancers have acquired mutations that lead to activation of the 
      phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway, which plays a central role in 
      cellular processes that are essential in cancer, such as cell survival, growth, 
      division and motility. Oncogenic mutations in the PI3K pathway generally involve 
      either activating mutation of the gene encoding PI3K (PIK3CA) or AKT (AKT1), or loss 
      or reduced expression of PTEN. Several kinases involved in PI3K signaling are being 
      explored as a therapeutic targets for pharmacological inhibition. Despite the 
      availability of a range of inhibitors, acquired resistance may limit the efficacy of 
      single-agent therapy. In this review we discuss the role of PI3K pathway mutations 
      in human breast cancer and relevant genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs), 
      with special attention to the role of PI3K signaling in oncogenesis, in therapeutic 
      response, and in resistance to therapy. Several sophisticated GEMMs have revealed 
      the cause-and-effect relationships between PI3K pathway mutations and mammary 
      oncogenesis. These GEMMs enable us to study the biology of tumors induced by 
      activated PI3K signaling, as well as preclinical response and resistance to PI3K 
      pathway inhibitors.

TI  - [Current concepts and treatment advances in systemic mastocytosis].
PG  - 25-34
LID - 10.1016/j.revmed.2008.01.025 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Mast cell disorders are defined by an abnormal accumulation of tissue mast 
      cells in one or more organ systems. Clinical symptoms in mastocytosis result from 
      mast cells derived mediators and, less frequently, from destructive infiltration of 
      mast cells. Systemic mastocytosis is regressive among children, whereas the disease 
      is persistent among adults. A clonal haematological non-mast cell lineage disease 
      can be associated. The clinical course in these patients is variable ranging from 
      asymptomatic for years to highly aggressive and rapidly devastating. Until recently, 
      the only treatment of this incurable disease was symptomatic. CURRENT KNOWLEDGE AND 
      KEY POINTS: Recent advances were done in understanding the physiopathology of this 
      myeloproliferative syndrome which results from an activating mutation of the stem 
      cell factor receptor: C-Kit. A somatic C-Kit mutation is usually detectable in mast 
      cells and their progenitors. Different mutations were found and the mutation D816V 
      is the most frequent. Their specific transduction paths were also studied. Diagnosis 
      of systemic mastocytosis does not only rest upon pathological examination but also 
      on molecular as well as immunological and immunochemical tools. FUTURE PROSPECTS AND 
      PROJECTS: Physiopathological advancements led to suggest new treatments in order to 
      directly inhibit proliferative paths of masts cells such as tyrosine kinase 
      inhibitors and rapamycin.

AB  - Polycythemia vera (PV) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) characterised by the 
      V617F activating mutation in the tyrosine kinase JAK2. PV patients exhibit increased 
      haemoglobin levels and red cell mass because of uncontrolled proliferation of the 
      erythroid lineage. Thrombosis and transformation to acute leukaemia are the major 
      causes of morbidity and mortality in this disease. Increased thrombotic risk in PV 
      patients is multifactorial and complex; it is associated with high levels of 
      haemoglobin, impaired rheology and increased viscosity resulting from 
      erythrocytosis. An additional parameter that might contribute to this risk was 
      recently brought to light by work from our group showing abnormal activation of 
      adhesion proteins in PV RBCs. In this review we provide an overview of these recent 
      findings and discuss how the pro-adhesive features of JAK2V617F-positive red blood 
      cells might initiate and contribute to the circulatory complications described in 
      PV.

PG  - 299-308
LID - 10.1002/gcc.20743 [doi]
AB  - T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is the result of multiple oncogenic 
      insults of thymocytes. Recently, new ABL1 fusion genes have been identified that 
      provide proliferation and survival advantage to lymphoblasts. These are the 
      NUP214-ABL1 fusion gene, on amplified episomes, the unique case of EML1-ABL1 fusion 
      due to a cryptic t(9;14)(q34;q32) and the seldom reported BCR-ABL1 and ETV6-ABL1 
      chimeric genes. The most frequent and strictly associated with T-ALL is the 
      NUP214-ABL1 fusion identified in 6% of cases, in both children and adults. Patients 
      present with classical T-ALL features. Cytogenetically, the fusion is cryptic but 
      seen by FISH on amplified episomes or more rarely as a small hsr. The ABL1 fusion is 
      a late event associated with other genetic alterations like NOTCH1 activating 
      mutation, deletion of CDKN2A locus, and ectopic expression of TLX1 or TLX3. The 
      mechanism of activation of the NUP214-ABL1 protein is unique and requires 
      localization at the nucleopore complex and interaction with other nuclear pore 
      proteins for crossphosphorylation and constitutive kinase activity. The ABL1 fusion 
      proteins are sensitive to tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which can be included in 
      future treatment strategy.

TI  - Hyperplastic and serrated polyps of the colorectum.
PG  - 947-68, viii
AB  - The serrated polyp pathway is a histopathological sequence that begins in a 
      hyperplastic polyp, or precursor serrated aberrant crypt focus, and has the 
      potential to end in a colonic adenocarcinoma that is CIMP-high and, in most cases, 
      also MSI. An activating mutation of the BRAF oncogene is a marker for this pathway. 
      There is evidence that aberrant CpG-island methylation is the molecular engine that 
      drives the progression through sequential steps of the pathway, from hyperplastic 
      polyp to a form of atypical hyperplastic polyp (termed sessile serrated adenoma) to 
      dysplastic serrated polyp and, ultimately to serrated carcinoma. A second serrated 
      pathway, identified by mutations of KRAS in serrated adenoma, is delineated less 
      completely. Its endpoint is a colorectal carcinoma that is CIMP-low and MSS, and 
      both the advanced serrated adenoma and carcinoma stages of this pathway show 
      molecular genetic and morphologic features that overlap with those of the 
      conventional APC carcinogenic pathway. Clinical studies are needed to elucidate the 
      natural history of serrated neoplasia, and provide evidence-based guidance for risk 
      assessment and surveillance of individuals discovered to harbor its various serrated 
      polyp precursors.

TI  - [Myeloproliferative diseases caused by JAK2 mutation].
PG  - 357-64
AB  - Polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia(ET), and primary myelofibrosis 
      (PMF) share common clinical features, being clonal disorders of multipotent 
      progenitors. In 2005, a somatic activating mutation in JAK2 (V617F) was identified 
      in most patients with PV and in about half of patients with ET or PMF. The JAK2 
      mutation causes the constitutive activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, and 
      leads to autonomous cell growth in a cytokine-independent manner. A higher 
      expression of JAK2 V617F would favor erythrocytosis, and a lower one would favor 
      thrombocytosis. This may suggest that the expression levels of JAK2 V617F directly 
      determine which cell lineages increase, possibly leading to the diversity of 
      myeloproliferative diseases. Although only V617F JAK2 may cause myeloproliferative 
      disease (MPD), clonogenic assay, analysis of familial MPD patients, and examination 
      of JAK2 mutation in acute leukemia patients transformed from MPD show that there are 
      additional somatic mutations which contribute to the pathogenesis of V617F JAK2 
      positive PV, ET, and PMF.

AB  - The regulatory agency approvals in the United States and Europe of imatinib mesylate 
      (Gleevec) for patients with bcr/abl-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia, cetuximab 
      (Erbitux) for patients with epidermal growth factor receptor overexpressing 
      metastatic colorectal cancer, the antiangiogenesis agent bevacizumab (Avastin), and 
      the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (Velcade)--and the considerable public interest 
      in new anticancer drugs that take advantage of specific genetic defects that render 
      the malignant cells more likely to respond to specific treatment--are driving a new 
      era of integrated diagnostics and therapeutics. The recent discovery of a drug 
      response predicting activating mutation in the epidermal growth factor receptor gene 
      for patients with non-small cell lung cancer treated with gefitinib (Iressa) has 
      intensified this interest. In this review, the history of targeted anticancer 
      therapies is highlighted, with focus on the development of molecular diagnostics for 
      hematologic malignancies and the emergence of trastuzumab (Herceptin), an 
      antibody-based targeted therapy for HER-2/neu overexpressing metastatic breast 
      cancer: The potential of pharmacogenomic strategies and the use of high-density 
      genomic microarrays to classify and select therapy for cancer are briefly 
      considered. This review also considers the widely held view that, in the next 5 to 
      10 years, the clinical application of molecular diagnostics will further 
      revolutionize the drug discovery and development process; customize the selection, 
      dosing, route of administration of existing and new therapeutic agents; and truly 
      personalize medical care for cancer patients.

AB  - Recent progress in molecular biology has shown that cancer cells acquire common 
      phenotypes such as self-sufficiency of growth signals, resistance to 
      anti-proliferative and apoptotic signals through the accumulation of genetic and 
      epigenetic changes. Recently developed anticancer drugs target these molecular 
      mechanisms and good results have been reported for various cancer types. In lung 
      cancer, tyrosine kinase inhibitors specific for the epidermal growth factor receptor 
      such as gefitinib and erlotinib have changed clinical practice dramatically. About 
      half of the Japanese patients with lung cancers harbor an activating mutation of the 
      epidermal growth factor receptor gene and they are very sensitive to epidermal 
      growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Progression-free survival of such 
      patients is approximately 10 months when treated with gefitinib, whereas the 
      survival for those treated with platinum doublet therapy is approximately 6 months. 
      Target therapies against echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4-anaplastic 
      lymphoma kinase fusion protein or a mutated ERBB2 (v-ERB-B avian erythroblastic 
      leukemia viral oncogene homologue 2) present in approximately 5% and approximately 
      3% of the Japanese patients with adenocarcinomas, respectively, are currently under 
      development. Addition of an anti-epidermal growth factor receptor antibody, 
      cetuximab, or anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antibody, bevacizumab, to 
      platinum doublet therapy significantly but modestly prolonged the survival in recent 
      clinical trials. However, clinical development of small molecule multi-kinase 
      inhibitors including those targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptors, 
      such as vandetanib, sunitinib and sorafenib, has not been very successful. Through 
      these collaborations among clinicians, basic researchers and pharmaceutical 
      companies, it should be possible to individualize lung cancer treatment to turn this 
      fatal disease into a chronic disorder and, eventually, to cure it.

TI  - Advances in the molecular characterization of Philadelphia-negative chronic 
      myeloproliferative disorders.
PG  - 628-34
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The identification and characterization of somatic disease 
      alleles have greatly improved our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of 
      myeloproliferative disorders. This review focuses on recent studies investigating 
      the role of activated tyrosine kinase signaling in the Philadelphia chromosome 
      negative myeloproliferative disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: Previously identified 
      tyrosine kinase mutations in chronic myeloid leukemia and other myeloproliferative 
      disorders suggested the possibility that polycythemia vera, essential 
      thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis are also caused by activated tyrosine 
      kinases. Recent studies identified an activating mutation in the JAK2 tyrosine 
      kinase (JAK2V617F) in most patients with polycythemia vera and in approximately half 
      of those with essential thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis. More recently, 
      activating mutations in the thrombopoietin receptor and in JAK2 exon 12 have been 
      identified in JAK2V617F negative myeloproliferative disorders. SUMMARY: The 
      discovery of activated tyrosine kinases in the majority of patients with 
      polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis has 
      diagnostic and pathogenetic implications. Subsequent studies are needed to elucidate 
      the cause of myeloproliferative disorders without known disease alleles and to 
      determine if inhibition of JAK2 signaling has therapeutic efficacy in the treatment 
      of polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis.

TI  - [New molecular targets in pancreatic cancer].
PG  - 503-12
LID - 10.1684/bdc.2008.0632 [doi]
AB  - The understanding of the biology of pancreatic carcinoma has greatly benefited from 
      studies of genetic alterations and molecular expression in experimental models as 
      well as in pre-cancerous and cancerous tissues by mean of molecular amplification 
      and large scale transcriptome analysis. P16, TP53, DPC4/Smad4 tumor suppressor 
      pathways are genetically inactivated in the majority of pancreatic carcinomas, 
      whereas oncogenic k-ras is activated. The activating mutation of the K-ras oncogene 
      on codon 12 seems to occur early in pancreatic carcinogenesis and detecting its 
      mutation in tumor samples could have a clinical relevance in term of positive 
      (improvement of current histological diagnosis) and differential diagnosis (versus 
      chronic pancreatitis) of pancreatic cancer. At a late stage of tumor development, an 
      increase of telomerase activity, an over expression of growth factors and/or their 
      receptors (EGF, nerve growth factor, gastrin, bombesin), of proangiogenic factors 
      (VEGF, FGF, PDGF), of invasiveness factors (metalloproteinases, E-cadherin, beta 
      integrin, urokinase and tissue plasminogen activator) occur. All these molecular 
      events contribute to the progression and to the metastatic potential of this 
      carcinoma. New markers and targets are currently studied among microRNA and 
      epigenetics events such as methylation and acetylation. Among all these molecular 
      markers, some are now tested for their potential clinical interest in term of 
      diagnosis or therapeutic target.

TI  - Profile of the Roche cobas® EGFR mutation test v2 for non-small cell lung cancer.
PG  - 209-215
LID - 10.1080/14737159.2017.1288568 [doi]
AB  - The discovery of driver mutations in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has led to 
      the development of genome-based personalized medicine. Fifteen to 20% of 
      adenocarcinomas harbor an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activating 
      mutation associated with responses to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). 
      Individual laboratories' expertise and the availability of appropriate equipment are 
      valuable assets in predictive molecular pathology, although the choice of methods 
      should be determined by the nature of the samples to be tested and whether the 
      detection of only well-characterized EGFR mutations or rather, of all detectable 
      mutations, is required. Areas covered: The EGFR mutation testing landscape is 
      manifold and includes both screening and targeted methods, each with their own pros 
      and cons. Here we review one of these companion tests, the Roche cobas® EGFR 
      mutation test v2, from a methodological point of view, also exploring its 
      liquid-biopsy applications. Expert commentary: The Roche cobas® EGFR mutation test 
      v2, based on real time RT-PCR, is a reliable option for testing EGFR mutations in 
      clinical practice, either using tissue-derived DNA or plasma-derived cfDNA. This 
      application will be valuable for laboratories with whose purpose is purely 
      diagnostic and lacking high-throughput technologies.

TI  - Successes and limitations of targeted cancer therapy in gastrointestinal stromal 
      tumors.
PG  - 51-61
LID - 10.1159/000355898 [doi]
AB  - In gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), molecularly targeted therapies, starting 
      with imatinib, are directed against an activating mutation of KIT or PDGFRA, which 
      drives the disease. Their efficacy has brought the median survival from one to at 
      least 5 years in the metastatic setting. Tumor response patterns may include tumor 
      shrinkage or not, but are marked by pathologic and radiological changes in tumor 
      tissue. Tumor sensitivity to imatinib can be precisely predicted by the mutational 
      status. However, the metastatic disease has not been truly converted into a chronic 
      condition since secondary resistance to imatinib remains a major limiting factor 
      occurring after a median of 2 years at least in most patients. Further-line 
      therapies are available, i.e. with sunitinib and regorafenib, which can prolong 
      progression-free survival for limited time intervals. Resistance is due to secondary 
      mutations. These give rise to a molecular heterogeneity, which represents a 
      formidable therapeutic challenge. However, the scenario has aspects of a 'liquid 
      resistance'. In fact, resistance may spread in a stepwise fashion throughout the 
      tumor: focal progression may be one possible clinical presentation, and tyrosine 
      kinase inhibitors may impact tumor growth even beyond conventional progression. In 
      addition, sensitive and resistant clones may expand and shrink depending on the 
      selective pressure of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, with be possible responses on 
      rechallenge with drugs. In the adjuvant treatment of high-risk molecularly sensitive 
      GIST, imatinib is able to substantially delay relapses, if due to occur, with a 
      limited survival benefit, though, apparently, without impacting the cure rate.

TI  - A clinical and biological overview of gastrointestinal stromal tumors.
PG  - 1-10
AB  - In the last few years a body of knowledge has been generated on the molecular basis 
      of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). These mesenchymal tumors are 
      characterized by the expression of KIT protein and because they have an activating 
      mutation in a class III receptor tyrosine kinase gene (KIT or PDGFRA). Several 
      KIT-activating mutations, which are largely responsible for the development of this 
      tumor, promote cell survival, proliferation, and migration through different 
      pathways such as MAPK p42/44, AKT, S6K, STAT1, and STAT3. Likewise, gene-activating 
      mutations in the gene PDGFRalpha which codes for the receptor tyrosine kinase, 
      Platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha have been identified in GIST lacking 
      KIT mutations. This means that KIT and PDGFRalpha mutations appear to be alternative 
      and mutually exclusive oncogenic pathways for GIST development. These tumors may 
      occur anywhere along the gastrointestinal tract (GI). The most frequently involved 
      sites are stomach and small intestine. They are typically chemo- and radioresistant. 
      The discovery of a specific inhibitor of this tyrosine kinase, imatinib mesylate, 
      has radically changed the prognosis of patients with unresectable disease. Only 4 yr 
      after the first patient was successfully treated with imatinib, multiple phase II 
      and III trials have been published and, currently, imatinib mesylate is the only 
      effective systemic treatment available of these tumors. Response rates are 
      approximately 70-90% with acceptable toxicity. GIST are the first model of a solid 
      tumor efficiently treated with a molecular-targeted agent. This review summarizes 
      the clinical and biological aspects of this unique neoplasm.

TI  - The case for a genetic predisposition to serrated neoplasia in the colorectum: 
      hypothesis and review of the literature.
PG  - 1778-84
AB  - In recent years, an alternative pathway of colorectal cancer development has been 
      described in which serrated polyps replace the traditional adenoma as the precursor 
      lesion. Importantly, serrated polyps and a subset of colorectal cancer show largely 
      nonoverlapping mutation profiles to those found in adenomas and the majority of 
      colorectal cancer. These genetic alterations include activating mutation of the BRAF 
      proto-oncogene and widespread gene promoter hypermethylation (CpG island methylator 
      phenotype or CIMP). Up to 15% of colorectal cancer is likely to develop on the basis 
      of a strong genetic predisposition. The two most well-characterized syndromes, 
      familial adenomatous polyposis and hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (Lynch 
      syndrome), both develop via the adenoma-carcinoma pathway and together account for 
      approximately one third of familial colorectal cancer. We have recently described 11 
      families in which there is evidence that the genetic predisposition to autosomal 
      dominant colorectal cancer is linked to the serrated pathway. This condition, 
      serrated pathway syndrome, and the related condition, hyperplastic polyposis, the 
      presentation of which suggests a recessive mode of inheritance, represent two 
      syndromes in which BRAF mutation and methylation co-occur within serrated precursor 
      lesions. Further, CIMP is observed in the normal colonic mucosa of individuals with 
      hyperplastic polyposis consistent with a field defect in epigenetic regulation. The 
      spectrum of serrated neoplasia may also implicate the apparently sporadic and later 
      onset subset of colorectal cancer with high levels of microsatellite instability. 
      The tendency for these lesions to be multiple, associated with smoking, and to show 
      frequent BRAF mutation and CIMP points to a defect that may result from interactions 
      between the environment and a weakly penetrant genetic alteration.

AB  - Approximately 90 % of gastrointestinal tumors (GISTs) harbor an activating mutation 
      in KIT or PDGFR alpha oncogene known to confer imatinib sensitivity. Imatinib is a 
      tyrosine kinase inhibitor of KIT and PDGFRs that yields a 6-months progression-free 
      survival (PFS) rate of 80 % in patients with advanced GISTs. Several studies have 
      shown that response to imatinib in GIST patients mainly depends on the mutational 
      status of KIT or PDGFR alpha. Moreover, most if not all patients treated with 
      imatinib for advanced GIST will secondarily develop progressive disease under 
      treatment. In the majority of cases, such progressions are the result of acquired 
      resistance due to occurrence of secondary C-KIT mutations; especially for GIST with 
      primary exon 11 mutations. Sunitinib is another approved drug and an inhibitor of 
      multiple tyrosine kinases including KIT, PDGFR alpha as well as PDGFR beta and 
      VEGFRs which are associated with angiogenesis. Sunitinib, in phase II and III trials 
      was associated with durable clinical benefit in nearly 25 % of patients with 
      advanced GIST resistant/intolerant to imatinib. Clearly, a better knowledge of the 
      molecular mechanisms underlying the resistance to imatinib as well as the 
      development of a new class of broad-spectrum tyrosine kinase inhibitors may allow in 
      the near future new individualized therapeutic strategies for GISTs patients.

PG  - 792-802
AB  - Dysregulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling due to receptor 
      overexpression or activating mutation is associated with cancer cell proliferation, 
      metastasis, and survival. EGFR has become an important therapeutic target for 
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and several EGFR-targeted agents, such as 
      tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), have been 
      developed. The EGFR-TKIs gefitinib, erlotinib, and afatinib have been approved for 
      the treatment of advanced NSCLC, and sensitivity to these drugs has been shown to be 
      associated with the presence of EGFR mutations. Various mAbs to EGFR have also been 
      evaluated in preclinical and clinical studies. In particular, phase III trials have 
      shown a clinically significant survival benefit for addition of the anti-EGFR mAbs 
      cetuximab or necitumumab to a platinum doublet in chemotherapy-naïve patients with 
      advanced NSCLC. We here summarize the results of completed and ongoing clinical 
      trials of EGFR-targeted mAbs for the treatment of NSCLC.

      phenotypic mimicry of chronic myeloproliferation.
PG  - 300-6
LID - 10.7326/0003-4819-152-5-201003020-00008 [doi]
AB  - The myeloproliferative disorders polycythemia vera, essential thrombocytosis, and 
      primary myelofibrosis are clonal disorders arising in a pluripotent hematopoietic 
      stem cell, causing an unregulated increase in the number of erythrocytes, 
      leukocytes, or platelets, alone or in combination; eventual marrow dominance by the 
      progeny of the involved stem cell; and a tendency to arterial or venous thrombosis, 
      marrow fibrosis, splenomegaly, or transformation to acute leukemia, albeit at widely 
      varying frequencies. The discovery of an activating mutation (V617F) in the gene for 
      JAK2 (Janus kinase 2), a tyrosine kinase utilized by hematopoietic cell receptors 
      for erythropoietin, thrombopoietin, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, 
      provided an explanation for the shared clinical features of these 3 disorders. 
      Constitutive JAK2 activation provides a growth and survival advantage to the 
      hematopoietic cells of the affected clone. Because signaling by the mutated kinase 
      utilizes normal pathways, the result is overproduction of morphologically normal 
      blood cells, an often indolent course, and (in essential thrombocytosis) usually a 
      normal life span. Because the erythropoietin, thrombopoietin, and granulocyte 
      colony-stimulating factor receptors are all constitutively activated, polycythemia 
      vera is the potential ultimate clinical phenotype of the JAK2 V617F mutation and, as 
      a corollary, is the most common of the 3 disorders. The number of cells expressing 
      the JAK2 V617F mutation (the allele burden) seems to correlate with the clinical 
      phenotype. Preliminary results of clinical trials with agents that inhibit the 
      mutated kinase indicate a reduction in splenomegaly and alleviation of night sweats, 
      fatigue, and pruritus.

AB  - The elucidation of the molecular alterations in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
      and the development of molecularly targeted agents have permanently shifted NSCLC 
      therapy to a personalized approach. In the metastatic setting, the addition of the 
      anti-vascular endothelial growth factor monoclonal antibody, bevacizumab, to 
      chemotherapy improves overall survival. The oral epidermal growth factor receptor 
      (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors, gefitinib and erlotinib, prolong progression-free 
      survival in patients selected for the presence of an EGFR activating mutation. The 
      monoclonal antibody to EGFR, cetuximab, improves survival in patients with 
      metastatic NSCLC, and the inhibitor of the echinoderm microtubule-associated 
      protein-like 4-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (EML4-ALK) fusion protein, crizotinib, has 
      resulted in an unprecedented overall survival advantage in patients harboring the 
      EML4-ALK translocation. In the adjuvant setting, gefitinib has not been shown to 
      improve patient survival outcomes; however, there are several ongoing clinical 
      trials in the adjuvant setting evaluating the role of erlotinib, bevacizumab, and 
      the MAGE-A3 and MUC1 vaccines. The realm of personalized lung cancer therapy also 
      includes the study of chemotherapy selected on the basis of the pharmacogenetic 
      profile of a patient's tumor. Several ongoing clinical trials in both the metastatic 
      and adjuvant settings are studying the excision repair cross-complementing group 1 
      (ERCC1) protein, the ribonucleotide reductase subunit 1 (RRM1) protein, thymidylate 
      synthase, and BRCA1 as predictors of chemotherapy response. This review will outline 
      the current state of the art of personalized NSCLC therapy.

AB  - YAP1 is a transcriptional co-activator whose activity is controlled by the Hippo 
      signaling pathway. In addition to important functions in normal tissue homeostasis 
      and regeneration, YAP1 has also prominent functions in cancer initiation, 
      aggressiveness, metastasis, and therapy resistance. In this review we are discussing 
      the molecular functions of YAP1 and its roles in cancer, with a focus on the 
      different mechanisms of de-regulation of YAP1 activity in human cancers, including 
      inactivation of upstream Hippo pathway tumor suppressors, regulation by intersecting 
      pathways, miRNAs, and viral oncogenes. We are also discussing new findings on the 
      function and biology of the recently identified family of YAP1 gene fusions, that 
      constitute a new type of activating mutation of YAP1 and that are the likely 
      oncogenic drivers in several subtypes of human cancers. Lastly, we also discuss 
      different strategies of therapeutic inhibition of YAP1 functions.

TI  - [Treatment strategy for activating EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer after 
      failure of first-generation EGFR-TKIs].
PG  - 533-8
AB  - Somatic activating mutations such as a deletion in exon 19 or the missense mutation 
      L858R in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor(EGFR)are 
      important mediators of cancer cell oncogenesis, proliferation, and survival. In the 
      last decade, two EGFR target agents have significantly contributed to the 
      understanding of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Gefitinib and erlotinib are 
      first-generation EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors(EGFR-TKIs)that play a key role in 
      activating EGFR-mutated NSCLC. Although these reversible, small, molecular target 
      agents provide a significant response and survival benefit, all responders 
      eventually acquire resistance. Although various mechanisms of resistance have been 
      identified, nearly 3 0% of patients who acquire resistance to EGFR-TKIs have an 
      unknown mechanism of resistance. Approximately half the patients with EGFR-mutated 
      NSCLC who develop acquired resistance to these molecular target agents have a 
      secondary mutation T790M in the threonine gatekeeper residue that coexists with a 
      primary EGFR activating mutation. The strategy for overcoming acquired resistance to 
      first-generation EGFR-TKIs is a major clinical concept. Afatinib is a 
      second-generation EGFR-targeting agent and an irreversible pan-HER inhibitor. It may 
      improve survival further and help in potentially overcoming resistance to 
      first-generation EGFR-TKIs in EGFR-mutated NSCLC. In patients harboring activating 
      EGFR mutations, certain treatments could be suggested for subsequent therapy after 
      failure of first-generation EGFR-TKIs. This review discusses novel therapeutic 
      strategies for activating EGFR-mutated, advanced NSCLC after failure of 
      first-generation EGFR-TKIs.

TI  - [Akt kinase: a key regulator of metabolism and progression of tumors].
PG  - 490-503
AB  - The serine/threonine protein kinase Akt is a major transducer of the 
      phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathway and plays a crucial role in regulation of cellular 
      processes such as growth, metabolism, survival and proliferation. Mammalian cells 
      are characterized by the expression of three different Akt isoforms (Akt1, Akt2, 
      Akt3), encoded by distinct genes. Increased expression and activation of Akt 
      observed in many human cancers is usually caused by amplification or mutation of Akt 
      genes, amplification and activating mutation of the catalytic subunit of PI3K or 
      deletion and mutations of phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate phosphatase--PTEN. 
      Although activation of Akt alone is believed to be insufficient for tumorigenesis, 
      it contributes to cancer progression by inhibiting apoptosis, promoting changes in 
      metabolism and proliferation of cells and regulating their migration and invasion 
      capabilities. Recent studies have provided evidence that depending on the cell type 
      each specific Akt isoform may play a positive or negative role in cell migration and 
      invasion. Akt is also involved in regulation of tumor angiogenesis.

AB  - Trastuzumab-containing therapy is a standard of care for human epidermal growth 
      factor receptor-2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer. In pre-clinical models, a wide 
      range of molecular mechanisms have been associated with reduced sensitivity to 
      trastuzumab in vitro. These include expression of the truncated HER2 receptor 
      fragment p95HER2, activating mutation of the gene encoding the class 1A catalytic 
      subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PIK3CA), loss of phosphatase and tensin 
      homolog (PTEN), activation of other downstream signal transducers, prevention of 
      cell cycle arrest, increased signaling through alternative (HER or non-HER) tyrosine 
      kinase receptors, and resistance to antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. 
      However, the clinical significance of these mechanisms as determinants of 
      trastuzumab efficacy in vivo has been unclear. Here, we review clinical studies of 
      potential predictive biomarkers of trastuzumab efficacy in HER2-positive breast 
      cancer and consider whether evaluation of such markers might inform patient 
      selection for therapy. We find that clinical evidence relating to potential 
      predictive biomarkers is mostly limited to small, retrospective studies, many of 
      which have yielded conflicting findings. Some trends are evident in the 
      retrospective data and in biomarker analyses from randomized clinical trials, 
      particularly relating to activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway, 
      but none is sufficiently strong to form a basis for patient selection. This may be 
      explained by the fact that multiple mechanisms of action determine the clinical 
      efficacy of trastuzumab. In the absence of novel, validated biomarkers of efficacy, 
      trastuzumab eligibility should continue to be based on evaluation of HER2 status 
      according to standard methods.

TI  - An update on molecular genetics of gastrointestinal stromal tumours.
PG  - 557-63
AB  - Gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs) are the most common primary mesenchymal 
      tumours of the gastrointestinal tract. Most of them show activating mutations of the 
      genes coding for KIT or platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRalpha), 
      two receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). The RTK inhibitor Imatinib (Gleevec, Novartis, 
      Switzerland), induces regression of the tumour. The level of response to treatment, 
      together with other clinicopathological parameters is related to the type and site 
      of the activating mutation, thus suggesting that these tumours should be classified 
      according to the molecular context. This is confirmed also by the phenomenon of the 
      resistance to treatment, which arises because of different mechanisms (second 
      mutation, amplification, activation of other RTKs) and can be fought only by 
      specific RTK inhibitors, that are at present under development. RTK activation 
      involves an homogeneous transduction pathway whose components (MAPK, AKT, PI3K, mTOR 
      and RAS) are possible targets of new molecular treatment. A new paradigm of 
      classification integrating the classic pathological criteria with the molecular 
      changes will permit personalised prognosis and treatment.

      develop along the gastrointestinal tract. Over ten years ago, their management 
      dramatically changed following the discovery of an activating mutation of the KIT 
      oncogene, which led to the use of small molecule inhibitors to therapeutically 
      target these mutant kinases. Patients with advanced GIST, who were once a subset of 
      sarcoma with poor prognosis due to their lack of chemosensitivity, may now survive 
      more than 5 years following treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) such as 
      imatinib mesylate (IM) and sunitinib malate (SU). After ten years of active clinical 
      and preclinical research, it has become clear that, although relatively homogeneous 
      compared to other solid malignancies, there is still some heterogeneity in GISTs and 
      most notably in regard to response to therapy. Here, we review the current data 
      regarding molecular prediction of response in this disease.

TI  - Gastrointestinal stromal tumor: 5 years later.
PG  - 1781-8
AB  - There is now considerable interest in gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) because 
      it can be treated effectively with a targeted molecular agent. The majority of GISTs 
      contain an activating mutation in the KIT protooncogene or, occasionally, in the 
      platelet-derived growth factor-alpha (PDGFRA) gene. Five years ago, imatinib 
      mesylate, a specific molecular inhibitor of the protein products of these 2 genes, 
      was applied to metastatic GIST. Approximately 80% of patients with metastatic GIST 
      benefit from imatinib, although acquired resistance to the agent may develop. For 
      patients with primary GIST, surgery remains the treatment of choice, and whether 
      outcome is improved by adjuvant imatinib is currently under broad investigation. A 
      combination of imatinib therapy and surgery also may be effective in a subset of 
      patients with metastatic or unresectable primary GIST. In this review, the authors 
      summarize the new multimodality approach to GIST. The integration of surgery and 
      molecular therapy in GIST will serve as a prototype for the management of other 
      solid tumors for which targeted agents become available.

TI  - The role of oncogenes in chemical carcinogenesis.
PG  - 81-6
AB  - Proto-oncogenes are cellular genes that are expressed during normal growth and 
      developmental processes. Altered versions of normal proto-oncogenes have been 
      implicated in the development of human neoplasia. In this report, we show the 
      detection of activated proto-oncogenes in various spontaneous and chemically induced 
      rodent tumors. The majority of activated proto-oncogenes found in these tumors are 
      members of the ras gene family and have been activated by a point mutation. 
      Characterization of the activating mutation may be useful in determining whether 
      this proto-oncogene was activated by direct interaction of the chemical with the 
      DNA. Comparison of activating lesions in spontaneous versus chemically induced 
      tumors should be helpful in determining whether the chemical acts via a genotoxic or 
      a nongenotoxic mechanism. All of this information may be helpful in the assessment 
      of potential carcinogenic hazards of human exposure to chemicals.

TI  - Luteinizing hormone receptor mutations in disorders of sexual development and 
      cancer.
PG  - D343-52
AB  - Human male sexual development is regulated by chorionic gonadotropin (CG) and 
      luteinizing hormone (LH). Aberrant sexual development caused by both activating and 
      inactivating mutations of the human luteinizing hormone receptor (LHR) have been 
      described. All known activating mutations of the LHR are missense mutations caused 
      by single base substitution. The most common activating mutation is the replacement 
      of Asp-578 by Gly due to the substitution of A by G at nucleotide position 1733. All 
      activating mutations are present in exon 11 which encodes the transmembrane domain 
      of the receptor. Constitutive activity of the LHR causes LH releasing 
      hormone-independent precocious puberty in boys and the autosomal dominant disorder 
      familial male-limited precocious puberty (FMPP). Both germline and somatic 
      activating mutations of the LHR have been found in patients with testicular tumors. 
      Activating mutations have no effect on females. The molecular genetics of the 
      inactivating mutations of the LHR are more variable and include single base 
      substitution, partial gene deletion, and insertion. These mutations are not 
      localized and are present in both the extracellular and transmembrane domain of the 
      receptor. Inactivation of the LHR gives rise to the autosomal recessive disorder 
      Leydig cell hypoplasia (LCH) and male hypogonadism or male pseudohermaphroditism. 
      Severity of the clinical phenotype in LCH patients correlates with the amount of 
      residual activity of the mutated receptor. Females are less affected by inactivating 
      mutation of the LHR. Symptoms caused by homozygous inactivating mutation of the LHR 
      include polycystic ovaries and primary amenorrhea.

TI  - Origin of Somatic Mutations in β-Catenin versus Adenomatous Polyposis Coli in Colon 
      Cancer: Random Mutagenesis in Animal Models versus Nonrandom Mutagenesis in Humans.
PG  - 1369-1375
LID - 10.1021/acs.chemrestox.7b00092 [doi]
AB  - Wnt signaling is compromised early in the development of human colorectal cancer 
      (CRC) due to truncating nonsense mutations in adenomatous polyposis coli (APC). CRC 
      induced by chemical carcinogens, such as heterocyclic aromatic amines and 
      azoxymethane, in mice also involves dysregulation of Wnt signaling but via 
      activating missense mutations in the β-catenin oncogene despite the fact that 
      genetically modified mice harboring an inactive APC allele efficiently develop CRC. 
      In contrast, activating mutations in β-catenin are rarely observed in human CRC. 
      Dysregulation of the Wnt signaling pathway by the two distinct mechanisms reveals 
      insights into the etiology of human CRC. On the basis of calculations related to DNA 
      adduct levels produced in mouse CRC models using mutagens, and the number of stem 
      cells in the mouse colon, we show that two nonsense mutations required for biallelic 
      disruption of APC are statistically unlikely to produce CRC in experiments using 
      small numbers of mice. We calculate that an activating mutation in one allele near 
      the critical GSK3β phosphorylation site on β-catenin is >10(5)-times more likely to 
      produce CRC by random mutagenesis due to chemicals than inactivating two alleles in 
      APC, yet it does not occur in humans. Therefore, the mutagenesis mechanism in human 
      CRC cannot be random. We explain that nonsense APC mutations predominate in human 
      CRC because of deamination at 5-methylcytosine at CGA and CAG codons, coupled with 
      the number of human colonic stem cells and lifespan. Our analyses, including a 
      comparison of mutation type and age at CRC diagnosis in U.S. and Chinese patients, 
      also indicate that APC mutations in CRC are not due to environmental mutagens that 
      randomly damage DNA.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: 90% of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) harbor an activating 
      mutation in the KIT or PDGFRα oncogene, and these are known to confer imatinib 
      sensitivity. AREAS COVERED: The author reviews the data regarding the current 
      management of GIST, mechanisms of resistance to imatinib, and new drugs currently in 
      clinical development and provides his unique perspectives on the subject matter. 
      EXPERT OPINION: Several studies have shown that the response to imatinib in GIST 
      patients mainly depends on the mutational status of KIT or PDGFRα. Moreover, most, 
      if not all, patients treated with imatinib for advanced GIST will develop a 
      secondary progressive disease under the treatment. In most cases, such progressions 
      are the result of acquired resistance due to the occurrence of secondary c-KIT 
      mutations, especially in GISTs with primary exon 11 mutations. Sunitinib and 
      regorafenib are inhibitors of multiple tyrosine kinases, including KIT, PDGFRα, 
      PDGFRβ, and VEGFRs, and are approved for the management of imatinib- and 
      imatinib/sunitinib-refractory GIST patients, respectively. Clearly, better knowledge 
      of the molecular mechanisms underlying the resistance to imatinib as well as the 
      development of a new class of broad-spectrum tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as 
      avapritinib and ripretinib will provide new individualized therapeutic strategies 
      for GIST patients.

TI  - Insight into Discovery of Next Generation Reversible TMLR Inhibitors Targeting EGFR 
      Activating and Drug Resistant T790M Mutants.
PG  - 617-636

AB  - BACKGROUND: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a well-recognised drug target 
      exploited for treating non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Gefitinib and erlotinib 
      are first generation clinically employed inhibitors used against EGFR activating 
      mutants. However, during course of treatment these inhibitors become ineffective due 
      to the emergence of an acquired secondary mutation. Subsequently, in order to 
      overcome non-responsiveness second and third generation inhibitors were designed 
      having covalent bond and irreversible mode of action. However, these inhibitors were 
      shown to be toxic. This led to the discovery of lead candidates with completely 
      different mode of action and therapeutic efficacy. OBJECTIVE: We have reviewed the 
      recent efforts undertaken by researchers in discovering newer noncovalent reversible 
      next generation inhibitors for treating NSCLC. METHODS: We first studied the 
      optimization steps and pharmacokinetic variables of the synthesised molecules. We 
      also analysed bonds and interactions using PDB X-ray crystal structures as well as 
      scaffold and selectivity analysis was undertaken. RESULTS: We identified that ligand 
      lipophilic efficiency driven potency is a preferable optimisation parameter for 
      maintaining drug likeliness of the molecule. Also, few h-bonds were recognised as 
      major players in affecting the binding of compound. The scaffold analysis revealed 
      that ligand molecules with pyrimidine core exhibit higher inhibitory activity 
      against TMLR, as well as higher selectivity with respect to other kinases. 
      CONCLUSION: Next generation reversible inhibitors exhibited unique binding mode and 
      were found to occupy three major pockets (ribose pocket, back pocket and hinge 
      region), which is critical for increasing the selectivity of the compound against 
      TMLR mutants.

TI  - Polycythemia Vera: An Appraisal of the Biology and Management 10 Years After the 
      Discovery of JAK2 V617F.
PG  - 3953-60
LID - 10.1200/JCO.2015.61.6474 [doi]
AB  - Polycythemia vera (PV) is a chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm that is associated 
      with a substantial symptom burden, thrombohemorrhagic complications, and impaired 
      survival. A decade after the seminal discovery of an activating mutation in the 
      tyrosine kinase JAK2 in nearly all patients with PV, new treatment options are 
      finally beginning to emerge, necessitating a critical reappraisal of the underlying 
      pathogenesis and therapeutic modalities available for PV. Herein, we comprehensively 
      review clinical aspects of PV including diagnostic considerations, natural history, 
      and risk factors for thrombosis. We summarize recent studies delineating the genetic 
      basis of PV, including their implications for evolution to myelofibrosis and 
      secondary acute myeloid leukemia. We assess the quality of evidence to support the 
      use of currently available therapies, including aspirin, phlebotomy, hydroxyurea, 
      and interferon. We analyze recent studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of JAK 
      inhibitors, such as ruxolitinib, and evaluate their role in the context of other 
      available therapies for PV. This review provides a framework for practicing 
      hematologists and oncologists to make rational treatment decisions for patients with 
      PV.

TI  - Rationale and clinical experience with epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors 
      in gynecologic malignancies.
PG  - 103-14
AB  - The family of epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs) is overexpressed in many 
      gynecologic malignancies. Extensive preclinical studies of these receptors 
      demonstrate that they play an important role in supporting the growth of a wide 
      variety of malignancies and that interruption of receptor function or signaling from 
      these receptors leads to inhibition of tumor growth or in certain cases tumor 
      regression. Recently, many therapeutic agents targeting this receptor have entered 
      the clinic and phase II clinical studies have demonstrated activity in lung cancer, 
      colon cancer, and head and neck malignancies. Phase II trials of both small molecule 
      inhibitors of EGFR and antibody-based inhibitors are underway in both cervical and 
      ovarian cancer and emerging data suggests that their activity in unselected women 
      with advanced gynecologic malignancies is very modest. Recently, molecular analysis 
      of lung cancers has identified that the response to small molecule inhibitors of 
      EGFR is highly correlated with activating mutations within the EGFR. It is possible 
      that these agents will be highly effective in a small subset of patients with 
      gynecologic malignancies whose tumors are dependent on EGFR signaling, perhaps 
      through an activating mutation in EGFR or its downstream pathway. Until additional 
      research can identify the subset of patients most likely to benefit from this 
      targeted therapy, treatment for women with gynecologic malignancies with EGFR 
      inhibitors should be limited to investigational trials. It is critical that these 
      trials have access to tissue of responding and nonresponding patients so to 
      determine the rational use of these agents in the treatment of gynecologic 
      malignancies.

TI  - Advanced or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors: systemic treatment options.
PG  - 888-95
LID - 10.1002/jso.21930 [doi]
AB  - Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), the most common sarcoma arising in the 
      gastrointestinal tract, typically expresses the tyrosine-kinase receptor, C-KIT, and 
      contains activating mutation in the c-kit or platelet-derived growth factor receptor 
      (pdgfr) gene. Recently, development of small molecules that inhibit the kinase 
      activity of mutant C-KIT and PDGFR proteins has radically changed treatment and 
      prognosis of patients diagnosed with advanced GIST as this molecularly "targeted" 
      therapy has demonstrated remarkable high-level of activity in this disease.

TI  - The management of gastrointestinal stromal tumors: a model for targeted and 
      multidisciplinary therapy of malignancy.
PG  - 247-58

AB  - Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) has become a model for targeted therapy in 
      cancer. The vast majority of GISTs contain an activating mutation in either the KIT 
      or platelet-derived growth factor A (PDGFRA) gene. GIST is highly responsive to 
      several selective tyrosine kinase inhibitors. In fact, this cancer has been 
      converted to a chronic disease in some patients. Considerable progress has been made 
      recently in our understanding of the natural history and molecular biology of GIST, 
      risk stratification, and drug resistance. Despite the efficacy of targeted therapy, 
      though, surgery remains the only curative primary treatment and cures >50% of GIST 
      patients who present with localized disease. Adjuvant therapy with imatinib prolongs 
      recurrence-free survival and may improve overall survival. Combined or sequential 
      use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors with other agents following tumor molecular 
      subtyping is an attractive next step in the management of GIST.

TI  - The Kasumi-1 cell line: a t(8;21)-kit mutant model for acute myeloid leukemia.
PG  - 247-55
AB  - The Kasumi-1 cell line is an intensively investigated model system of Acute Myeloid 
      Leukemia with t(8;21) translocation, that represents 1 of the 2 main subtypes of 
      Core Binding Factor Leukemia (CBFL). Since establishment in 1991 the Kasumi-1 cell 
      line has provided the tool to study the peculiar molecular, morphologic, 
      immunophenotypic findings of AML with t(8;21) and the functional consequences of the 
      AML1-ETO fusion oncogene on myeloid differentiation. Leukemogenesis involves 
      multiple genetic changes and, as suggested by murine experiments and other findings 
      in humans, AML1-ETO expression may not be sufficient for full blown leukemia. In 
      agreement with the "two hits" model of leukemogenesis, based on the cooperation 
      between 1 class of mutations that impair hematopoietic differentiation and a second 
      class of mutations that confer a proliferative and/or survival advantage to 
      hematopoietic progenitors an activating mutation in the tyrosine kinase domain of 
      the c-kit gene was identified in the AML1/ETO expressing Kasumi-1 cell line. The 
      dosage of the Asn822Lys mutated allele was shown to be about 5-fold compared to the 
      normal allele and c-kit amplification was found to map to minute 4cen-q11 marker 
      chromosomes, likely derived from the extra chromosome 4 recorded in the newly 
      established cell line. The combination of t(8;21) and trisomy 4 leading to enhanced 
      dosage of a mutated kit allele is a feature of a few CBFL patients reproduced by the 
      Kasumi-1 cell model. The Kasumi-1 cell line, paralleling the commitment stage of CBF 
      leukemia also provides a valuable resource to investigate the effect of tyrosine 
      kinase kit mutant on the main KIT-regulated signal transduction pathways, i.e. MAPK, 
      PI3K/AKT and STAT3 and the diverse inhibitory effect exerted by STI 571 on these KIT 
      mutant activated pathways. PI3K-dependent activation of AKT and STAT activation was 
      observed in Kasumi-1 cells. Contrary to the expectations for an amplified tyrosine 
      kinase kit mutant, we found that STI 571 inhibited KIT Asn822Lys tyrosine 
      phosphorylation and downstream JNK and STAT3 effectors in Kasumi-1 cells, but had no 
      effect on constitutive activation of AKT, suggesting that signaling by tyrosine 
      kinases other than KIT may be responsible for its activation in Kasumi-1 cells. 
      Independent findings on the same model system provide complementary insights into 
      designing strategies for treatment of CBF leukemia associated with mutations in the 
      KIT catalytic domain.

PG  - 109-18
LID - 10.1358/dot.2012.48.2.1745274 [doi]
AB  - Advanced melanoma has a poor prognosis due to its resistance to traditional 
      chemotherapeutics, leading to the search for alternative treatment approaches. With 
      the finding that approximately 50% of melanomas harbor an activating mutation in the 
      serine/threonine-protein kinase B-raf gene (BRAF), inhibition of mutated B-raf 
      represented an attractive and innovative focus for the development of novel targeted 
      therapy potentially benefiting a large proportion of melanoma patients. Impressive 
      response rates with an overall survival benefit in addition to minimal 
      treatment-related toxicity in phase I-III clinical studies led to the FDA's approval 
      of vemurafenib for patients with locally advanced/unresectable or metastatic 
      BRAFV600E-mutated malignant melanoma in August 2011. While the majority of patients 
      with BRAF-mutated disease show favorable treatment responses shortly after 
      initiation of vemurafenib therapy, the median progression-free survival is 6 months, 
      making the search for resistance mechanisms a high priority. While vemurafenib 
      represents an excellent model for successful targeted anticancer therapy, long-term 
      safety data are needed and rational combination with other agents will be critical 
      to prevent or circumvent the development of resistance.

TI  - Serrated pathway and APC (conventional)-type colorectal polyps: 
      molecular-morphologic correlations, genetic pathways, and implications for 
      classification.
PG  - 146-53
AB  - This review addresses the genetic mutations and cell signaling pathway alterations 
      in colorectal premalignant polyps, focusing on the link between molecular changes 
      and morphologic features. Biallelic APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) mutations are 
      directly responsible for the specific and characteristic cytologic features of 
      dysplastic cells in conventional tubular adenomas. Sessile serrated adenomas (SSAs) 
      are the precursor lesions of the serrated neoplasia pathway. The BRAF activating 
      mutation and hypermethylation of SLC5A8, which mediates short chain fatty acid 
      transport, may be the important events in the genesis of SSAs. Intracellular 
      butyrate inhibits histone deacetylase, allowing histone hyperacetylation and, 
      eventually, transcriptional activation of specific genes. Decreased p21(WAF1/CIP1) 
      and activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway may be the key 
      intermediary alterations. Progressive loss of cell cycle control and decreased and 
      altered cytoplasmic differentiation produce the characteristic constellation of 
      morphologic changes of SSAs and traditional serrated adenomas.

TI  - Targeting PDGF receptors in cancer--rationales and proof of concept clinical trials.
PG  - 141-51
AB  - The platelet-derived growth factors (PDGF) are a pleotrophic family of peptide 
      growth factors that signal through cell surface, tyrosine kinase receptors (PDGFR) 
      and stimulate various cellular functions including growth, proliferation, and 
      differentiation. To date, PDGF expression has been demonstrated in a number of 
      different solid tumors, from glioblastomas to prostate carcinomas. In these various 
      tumor types, the biologic role of PDGF signaling can vary from autocrine stimulation 
      of cancer cell growth to subtler paracrine interactions involving adjacent stroma 
      and vasculature. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (formerly STI571, 
      Gleevec, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp, East Hanover, NJ) blocks activity of the 
      Bcr-Abl oncoprotein and the cell surface tyrosine kinase receptor c-Kit, and as such 
      was recently approved for several indications in the treatment on chronic myeloid 
      leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. In both of these examples the target 
      protein was identified by an oncogenic, activating mutation. Imatinib mesylate is 
      also a potent inhibitor of PDGFR kinase and is currently being evaluated for the 
      treatment of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and glioblastoma multiforme, based upon 
      evidence in these diseases of activating mutations in PDGFR. However, the PDGF 
      pathway may represent a therapeutic target in other solid tumors in which it is not 
      part of the oncogenic transformation. In order to investigate the potential biologic 
      implications of inhibiting PDGFR in these tumor types, clinical trials that 
      investigate both established clinical endpoints of response and benefit, as well as 
      surrogate endpoints that describe the biologic significance of PDGF inhibition in 
      vivo are needed.

AB  - Activating Kras mutations are a pervasive and characteristic feature of human 
      pancreatic cancer. In order to examine the earliest in vivo effects of oncogenic 
      Kras expression in the exocrine pancreas, we generated two lines of zebrafish 
      expressing eGFP alone or eGFP fused to human Kras with an activating mutation in 
      codon 12 (Kras G12V) driven by ptf1a regulatory elements using a BAC recombineering 
      strategy (Park et al., 2008). In this review, we describe the techniques that we 
      used to observe the effects of eGFP-Kras G12V expression in pancreatic progenitor 
      cells of the zebrafish embryo, as well as techniques used to characterize malignant 
      pancreatic tumors in the adult zebrafish. This zebrafish model of pancreatic 
      neoplasia provides a unique view of the effects of oncogenic Kras in the embryonic 
      pancreas and suggests that the zebrafish will be a useful model organism in which to 
      study the biology of Kras-initiated pancreatic neoplasia.

AB  - Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is a histone methyltransferase that functions as 
      the catalytic subunit of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). PRC2 represses 
      gene transcription through tri-methylation of lysine 27 of histone 3 (H3K27me3) by 
      its catalytic subunit EZH2. EZH2 is also involved in normal B cell differentiation. 
      EZH2 deregulation has been described in many cancer types including hematological 
      malignancies. The oncogenic addiction of tumor cells to EZH2 represents a 
      therapeutic target in several hematological malignancies and solid cancers. Specific 
      small molecules have been recently developed to target cancer cells with EZH2 
      overexpression or activating mutation. Their therapeutic potential is currently 
      under evaluation. In particular, EZH2 is overexpressed in multiple myeloma (MM), a 
      neoplasia characterized by the accumulation of clonal plasma cells within the bone 
      marrow, with biological functions in the pathophysiology. This review summarizes the 
      roles of EZH2 in B cell differentiation and pathologic hematological processes with 
      a particular focus in multiple myeloma. We also discuss recent advances in the 
      development of EZH2 inhibitors for the personalized treatment of patients with 
      hematological malignancies.

      in medical oncology.
PG  - 5650-9
LID - 10.1200/JCO.2009.22.9054 [doi]
AB  - Selective kinase inhibitors have emerged as an important class of anticancer agents, 
      with demonstrated clinical efficacy and generally favorable toxicity profiles in 
      several common disease settings where conventional treatments have previously 
      provided only modest benefit. Consequently, a substantial effort is now underway to 
      identify additional therapeutically relevant kinase targets and to develop and test 
      inhibitors of those proteins in a variety of human malignancies. However, it has 
      also become clear that the clinical benefit associated with these agents is 
      typically limited to a subset of treated patients, who in many cases are defined by 
      a specific genomic lesion within their tumor cells--frequently, an activating 
      mutation within the gene encoding the target kinase. This discovery has prompted 
      efforts to stratify patients before treatment with kinase inhibitors based on 
      specific genomic biomarkers, with the goal of optimizing clinical outcomes through 
      the effective personalization of treatment (ie, matching the right patients with the 
      right therapies). With recent advances in our understanding of the relationship 
      between tumor genotypes and cancer cell sensitivity to kinase inhibition, together 
      with improved technologies for rapidly genotyping tumor biopsies for relevant 
      lesions, the implementation of personalized cancer care with this exciting new class 
      of inhibitors is now becoming a reality. In this review, we summarize recent 
      developments in this area, and we highlight some of the logistical challenges posed 
      by this emerging paradigm in medical oncology.

AB  - The E-cadherin-beta-catenin complex plays a pivotal role in epithelial cell-cell 
      adhesion and in the maintenance of differentiated adult epithelia. Perturbation of 
      its expression or function is widely involved in tumor progression and metastasis. 
      Recent years have seen a rapid expansion in the understanding of the biology and the 
      clinical relevance of the E-cadherin adhesion complex in human lung cancer. During 
      human lung cancer progression genomic, transcriptional and post-transcriptional 
      alterations of the E-cadherin-beta-catenin adhesion system are implicated and 
      comprise deletion of the chromosomic region 3p21 that comprise the locus of the gene 
      encoding beta-catenin, transcriptional downregulation of E-cadherin, cytoplasmic 
      redistribution, phosphorylation of both proteins and proteolysis of E-cadherin. 
      E-cadherin-inactivating mutations and oncogenic-activating mutation of beta-catenin 
      are not reported.

TI  - Mechanisms of resistance to RAF inhibition in melanomas harboring a BRAF mutation.
LID - 10.1200/EdBook_AM.2013.33.e80 [doi]
AB  - Treatment of V600E/K BRAF-mutated melanomas with RAF inhibitors (either vemurafenib 
      or dabrafenib) results in rapid and dramatic responses in most patients-results that 
      are associated with improved progression-free survival (PFS) and in the case of 
      vemurafenib, overall survival (OS). However, resistance develops at a median time of 
      approximately 6 months. Understanding the mechanisms of resistance is critical to 
      develop strategies to prolong PFS and OS. Negative feedback mechanisms inherent in 
      the MAPK pathway serve to modulate responses to these drugs. However, genetic 
      changes develop within the tumor, which lead to reactivation of the MAPK and 
      resistance to these drugs. The mechanisms that have been demonstrated in many 
      patients by multiple investigators are (1) development of an activating mutation in 
      NRAS, and (2) appearance of a BRAFV600E splice variant that encourages RAF 
      dimerization. Several other mechanisms of resistance have also been described in 
      individual patients or in preclinical models of resistance. In addition, there is 
      evidence that activation of parallel pathways, such as the PI3K/AKT pathway, may 
      represent another mechanism of resistance. Understanding the various mechanisms of 
      resistance will inform our attempts to prevent resistance to RAF inhibitors.

TI  - The role of parvovirus B19 and the immune response in the pathogenesis of acute 
      leukemia.
PG  - 133-55
LID - 10.1002/rmv.1830 [doi]
AB  - In this article, we review the evidence suggesting a possible role for B19 virus in 
      the pathogenesis of a subset of cases of acute leukemia. Human parvovirus B19 
      infection may complicate the clinical course of patients with acute leukemia and may 
      also precede the development of acute leukemia by up to 180 days. Parvovirus B19 
      targets erythroblasts in the bone marrow and may cause aplastic crisis in patients 
      with shortened-red cell survival. Aplastic crisis represents a prodrome of acute 
      lymphoblastic leukemia in 2% patients. There is a significant overlap between those 
      HLA classes I and II alleles that are associated with a vigorous immune response and 
      development of symptoms during B19 infection and those HLA alleles that predispose 
      to development of acute leukemia. Acute symptomatic B19 infection is associated with 
      low circulating IL-10 consistent with a vigorous immune response; deficient IL-10 
      production at birth was recently found to be associated with subsequent development 
      of acute leukemia. Anti-B19 IgG has been associated with a particular profile of 
      methylation of human cancer genes in patients with acute leukemia, suggesting an 
      additional hit and run mechanism. The proposed role for parvovirus B19 in the 
      pathogenesis of acute leukemia fits well with the delayed infection hypothesis and 
      with the two-step mutation model, which describes carriage of the first mutation 
      prior to birth, followed by suppression of hematopoiesis, which allows rapid 
      proliferation of cells harboring the first mutation, acquisition of a second 
      activating mutation, and expansion of cells carrying both mutations, resulting in 
      acute leukemia.

TI  - Metastatic Liver Disease Associated with Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors: 
      Controversies in Diagnostic and Therapeutic Approach.
PG  - 237-42
LID - 10.1007/s12029-015-9748-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most frequent 
      mesenchymal lesions of the GI tract. They are considered to originate from 
      neoplastic transformation of either the intestinal pacemaker cells of Cajal or the 
      precursor pluripotential stem cells. The genetic basis of GIST growth is an 
      activating mutation of two receptor tyrosine kinases. Recent epidemiologic studies 
      demonstrate that the GIST prevalence is approximately 20/1000000/year. Although 
      GISTs develop in every part of the GI tract, stomach remains the most common 
      localization. About 80 % of the patients experience tumor recurrence or hepatic 
      metastasis after radical resection. GIST liver metastases are usually multiple, 
      large in diameter, and localized in both lobes. In addition, GISTs are usually 
      completely asymptomatic, discovered incidentally. Symptoms are not typical and 
      depend on the location, size, and aggressiveness of the tumor. DISCUSSION: 
      Diagnostic evaluation is based on imaging techniques, such as computed tomography, 
      magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, and endoscopic ultrasound. 
      Despite recent research on the therapeutic strategies against GISTs, surgical 
      resection appears the only potentially curative approach. For the advanced 
      metastatic disease, imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has been proposed 
      neoadjuvantly with the surgery performed after the adequate reduction of tumor 
      burden. The aim of this review was to evaluate the results of surgical treatment for 
      metastatic GIST with special reference to the extent of its histological spread and 
      to present the recent literature in order to provide an update on the current 
      concepts of advanced surgical management of this entity.

TI  - Growth regulatory factors and signalling proteins in testicular germ cell tumours.
PG  - 212-24; discussion 224
AB  - The molecular basis of testicular germ cell tumourigenesis are not well elucidated. 
      Growth factors regulate cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis. Major families 
      of growth factors are present in the male gonad from early fetal development to 
      adult life. They are involved in germ cell proliferation and differentiation. Growth 
      signalling pathways suffer deregulation in many human malignancies. Given the 
      importance of growth signals in normal testicular development and their acquired 
      deregulation in most human cancers, growth factors and signalling molecules that 
      have been implicated in the genesis of testicular germ cell tumours, are reviewed. 
      We detected a somatic mutation of SMAD4 gene, responsible for loss of protein 
      function in seminomas. This mutational inactivation may affect the activity of 
      several members of TGFbeta superfamily (TGFbeta, activin, inhibin, BMP). VEGF 
      expression has been shown to predict metastasis in seminomas. A significant 
      association of HST-1 expression, a member of fibroblast growth factors, with the 
      nonseminomatous phenotype and with tumour stage has been described. In contrast, 
      C-KIT is expressed by seminomas only, from the preinvasive stage. Despite intense 
      expression in almost all seminomas, activating mutation of C-KIT gene is seldom 
      reported. Recently, the first animal model of classical testicular seminoma has been 
      identified in transgenic mouse overexpressing GDNF. RET (GDNF receptor) expression 
      is demonstrated in human seminomas, and not in nonseminomatous tumours. However, the 
      exact molecular alterations of GDNF/RET/GFRalpha1 complex in germ cell tumours are 
      not known. Finally, beside growth factors, other signalling molecules such as 
      peptide hormones may be involved in testicular carcinogenesis. We have demonstrated 
      a specific pattern of somatostatin receptors expression in each type of testicular 
      germ cell tumours, with a loss of sst3 and sst4 in seminomas and loss of sst4 and 
      expression of sst1 in nonseminomas only. These data suggest an antiproliferative 
      action of somatostatin in testicular cancers. In summary, many growth factors and 
      signalling molecules seem to represent specific markers for different histological 
      types of germ cell tumours (seminomas versus nonseminomas) and may play a role in 
      the differentiation of germ cell tumours. Despite a complex signalling pathway 
      involved in the physiological functions of male gonad, little is known about the 
      implication of this signalling network in testicular malignancies. From a practical 
      stand-point, further studies on the role of growth factors in human germ cell 
      tumours may offer a new therapeutical perspective with the development of specific 
      pharmacological signalling modulators that could be used as therapeutic agents.

TI  - Agminated blue nevus with a GNAQ mutation: A case report and review of the 
      literature.
PG  - 130-133
LID - 10.1111/cup.13373 [doi]
AB  - Agminated blue nevi are dermal melanocytic proliferations that classically present 
      as dark blue macules or papules in a grouped, linear, or blaschkoid distribution. In 
      their more common sporadic form, blue nevi manifest in young adulthood as solitary 
      blue papules or macules on the scalp, face, hands, or feet. By contrast, agminated 
      blue nevi tend to manifest earlier in life, and are distributed more evenly across 
      anatomic sites. Recent studies have identified mutations in sporadic blue nevi in 
      the genes encoding G Protein subunit alpha Q and G protein subunit alpha 11 (GNAQ 
      and GNA11). It is unknown whether agminated blue nevi share the same genetic 
      changes. In the present paper, we present a case of agminated blue nevus on the 
      wrist, and identify an activating mutation (c.626A > T, p.Glu209Leu) in GNAQ. We 
      hypothesize that GNAQ/GNA11 activating mutations arising earlier during development 
      may trigger agminated blue nevi, explaining the broader field of involvement in 
      these cutaneous lesions.

TI  - Drug resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors for non-small cell lung cancer.
PG  - 191-200
AB  - Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring an activating mutation within the 
      epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was defined as a clinically distinct 
      molecular group. These lesions show oncogene addiction to EGFR and dramatic 
      responses to the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Several large Phase III 
      trials have shown that EGFR-TKIs improved the progression-free survival of patients 
      with EGFR mutant NSCLC compared to conventional chemotherapy. However, the long-term 
      effectiveness of EGFR-TKIs is usually limited because of acquired drug resistance. 
      To overcome this resistance to EGFR-TKIs, it will be essential to identify the 
      specific mechanisms underlying the resistance. Many investigators have attempted to 
      identify the mechanisms using preclinical models and drug-resistant clinical 
      samples. As a result, several mechanisms have been showed to be responsible for the 
      resistance, but not all of the relevant mechanisms have been uncovered. In this 
      review, we provide an overview of mechanisms underlying drug-resistance to 
      EGFR-TKIs, focusing on results obtained with preclinical models, and we present some 
      possible strategies to overcome the EGFR-TKI resistance.

PG  - 95-8
LID - 10.1684/bdc.2012.1688 [doi]
AB  - Chemotherapy, as all systemic treatments, is generally effective in brain metastases 
      because the brain blood barrier (BBB) does not affect treatment's diffusion. 
      Platinum-based chemotherapy provides response rates ranging from 23 to 50% for brain 
      metastases. Anti-EGFR therapies are effective mostly when a somatic EGFR activating 
      mutation is detected, or in selected population (adenocarcinoma, Asian population, 
      never-smokers and women): response rate ranges from 38 to 69.6%. Bevacizumab is now 
      allowed for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with brain metastases and 
      non-squamous histology. The presence of untreated brain metastases may not influence 
      its efficacy combined with paclitaxel-carboplatin. The best sequence for 
      multimodality management of brain metastases has to be established but upfront 
      systemic treatments in patients with asymptomatic brain metastases is a valid 
      option.

AB  - The paradigm for first-line treatment of relapsed or metastatic non-small cell lung 
      cancer (NSCLC) is changing. Large phase III trials demonstrated that, in 2010, we 
      cannot select a therapy without an accurate definition of tumor histology and 
      epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) status. Patients harboring an 
      EGFR-activating mutation have a better prognosis and certainly are extremely 
      sensitive to EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors, while other agents, such as 
      bevacizumab or pemetrexed, are more effective and less toxic in patients with 
      non-squamous histology. Moreover, data from large phase III trials demonstrated that 
      maintenance therapy with pemetrexed, docetaxel or erlotinib is an effective strategy 
      against metastatic NSCLC. Overall, the changing paradigm in first-line treatment of 
      NSCLC inevitably is changing the second-line strategy. In addition, the emerging 
      role of maintenance therapy is leading to early use of all agents potentially active 
      in a second- or third-line setting, with the consequence that very few options are 
      available at disease progression. The aim of this article is to discuss the 
      consequences of targeted treatments for second-line therapy in metastatic NSCLC.

AB  - Mastocytosis is an accumulation of clonal mast cells within tissues and it is most 
      commonly caused by an activating mutation in the KIT gene. In this study, we report 
      a neonatal case who presented with diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis (CM) at birth. In 
      China, nine other cases of neonatal-onset CM have been reported in the literature 
      since 2006. In those cases, diffuse CM and urticaria pigmentosa were the main 
      symptoms, and mutations in exon 17 at codon 816 in KIT were identified.

TI  - Drugging the bad "AKT-TOR" to overcome TKI-resistant lung cancer.
PG  - 6-8
AB  - EGFR kinase inhibitors constitute an important class of lung cancer treatments. 
      While they produce dramatic responses in a subset of patients-primarily those with 
      activating EGFR mutations-remissions are typically limited to several months due to 
      acquired drug resistance, frequently associated with the secondary T790M mutation in 
      EGFR. In this issue of Cancer Cell, Li et al. report that an irreversible EGFR 
      kinase inhibitor, HKI-272, had limited activity in a mouse lung cancer model driven 
      by an EGFR mutant harboring T790M and an activating mutation. However, combining 
      HKI-272 with rapamycin promoted rapid tumor regression, suggesting a therapeutic 
      strategy to overcome drug resistance.

TI  - [Relevant mutations in predictive breast cancer pathology].
PG  - 399-404
LID - 10.1007/s00292-021-00929-6 [doi]
AB  - Whereas predictive immunohistochemistry has represented a core element of breast 
      cancer classification for decades, predictive molecular pathology, with the 
      exception of in situ hybridization for assessment of HER2 amplification, has only 
      recently gained importance because novel drugs have been approved for treatment of 
      metastatic disease. For the use of PARP inhibitors, proof of BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation 
      is mandatory. When mutation of the catalytic subunit α of the 
      phosphatidylinositol‑4.5‑bisphosphate 3‑kinase gene (PIK3CA) is present, which can 
      be encountered in up to 40% of luminal breast cancers, the option for treatment with 
      the specific inhibitor alpelisib arises. The HER2 -encoded growth factor receptor 
      contributes to neoplastic transformation not only by amplification and 
      overexpression but also by activating the mutation of the kinase domain, which is 
      responsive to tyrosine kinase inhibitors of the tucatinib/neratinib type. Up to 30% 
      of metastatic and endocrine treated luminal breast cancers acquire an activating 
      mutation of the estrogen receptor gene ESR1, resulting in an autocrine and 
      ligand-independent growth stimulation resistant to aromatase inhibitors. 
      Larotrectinib-sensitive mutation of tropomyosinreceptor kinase is present in up to 
      50% of secretory breast cancers, whereas the other histologic subtypes display an 
      incidence of below 1%. In conclusion, predictive molecular pathology has gained 
      importance in metastatic breast cancer.

TI  - Classes of c-KIT activating mutations: proposed mechanisms of action and 
      implications for disease classification and therapy.
PG  - 571-6
AB  - Mutations causing constitutive activation of KIT have been shown to be causative in 
      some forms of mastocytosis, and several types of mutations have been associated with 
      myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs), acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), sinonasal 
      lymphomas, and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). We divide these activating 
      mutation into two types - 'regulatory type' mutations, which affect regulation of 
      the kinase molecule, and 'enzymatic pocket type' mutations, which alter the amino 
      acid sequence directly forming the enzymatic site. KIT inhibitors have been 
      suggested as therapeutic drugs for these conditions, but different types of 
      activating mutations respond differentially to KIT inhibitors, so classification of 
      individuals on the basis of specific mutations is necessary to guide therapy.

      afatinib in EGFR activating mutation-positive advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.
PG  - S9-S17
LID - 10.3747/co.25.3732 [doi]
AB  - Despite recent advances in the systemic therapy of non-small-cell lung cancer 
      (nsclc), the prognosis for stage iv disease remains poor. The discovery of 
      targetable mutations has led to new treatment options. The most common mutations, 
      the EGFR activating mutations, are present in about 50% of Asian patients and up to 
      15% of white patients. First-generation reversible epidermal growth factor receptor 
      (egfr) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (tkis) have led to improved survival in patients 
      positive for EGFR activating mutations, but resistance eventually leads to disease 
      progression. The irreversible egfr tki afatinib was developed to counter such 
      resistance. The clinical efficacy of afatinib has been shown in first-line studies 
      comparing it with both cytotoxic chemotherapy and first-generation egfr tkis. 
      Afatinib has also shown continued benefit beyond progression while a patient is 
      taking an egfr inhibitor. Furthermore, its toxicity profile is both predictable and 
      manageable. The results of the principal clinical trials assessing afatinib are 
      reviewed here.

AB  - Individualized therapies that are tailored to a patient's genetic composition will 
      be of tremendous value for treatment of cancer. Recently, Kirsten ras (KRAS) status 
      has emerged as a predictor of response to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) 
      targeted therapies. In this article, we will discuss targeted therapies for 
      colorectal cancers (CRC) based on EGFR signaling pathway and review published data 
      about the potential usefulness of KRAS as a biological marker for response to these 
      therapies. Results from relevant studies published since 2005 and unpublished 
      results presented at national meetings were retrieved and summarized. These studies 
      reflected response (or lack of response) to EGFR-targeted therapies in patients with 
      metastatic CRC as a function of KRAS status. It has become clear that patients with 
      colorectal cancer whose tumor has an activating mutation in KRAS do not respond to 
      monoclonal antibody therapies targeting EGFR. It should now become a standard 
      practice that any patients being considered for EGFR targeted therapies have their 
      tumors tested for KRAS status and only those with wild-type KRAS being offered such 
      therapies.

AB  - Polycythemia vera (PV) is a chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by 
      clonal expansion of a hematopoietic progenitor, erythrocytosis, often leukocytosis 
      and/or thrombocytosis, and nearly always an activating mutation in Janus kinase 2 
      (JAK2). The PV symptom burden can be considerable, in part driven by small or large 
      vessel thrombotic tendency, splenomegaly, fatigue, pruritus, and a chronic risk of 
      disease transformation to myelofibrosis or acute myeloid leukemia. In addition, 
      patients with PV have an increased risk of mortality compared with the general 
      population that often results from cardiovascular complications or disease 
      transformation. Further, healthcare utilization and costs are higher in patients 
      with PV than noncancer controls. First-line therapy options for high-risk patients 
      may effectively manage PV in some instances; however, some patients do not receive 
      adequate benefit from current treatment options and experience a more severe disease 
      burden as a result. This may be especially true for those patients who are resistant 
      to or intolerant of hydroxyurea or interferon-based therapies. New treatments 
      currently being investigated in phase 3 clinical trials may alleviate disease burden 
      in this patient population.

TI  - RET haplotype, not linked to the C620R activating mutation, associated with 
      Hirschsprung disease in a novel MEN2 family.
PG  - 57-61
LID - S1807-59322012001300011 [pii]
AB  - Hirschsprung disease is a congenital form of aganglionic megacolon that results from 
      cristopathy. Hirschsprung disease usually occurs as a sporadic disease, although it 
      may be associated with several inherited conditions, such as multiple endocrine 
      neoplasia type 2. The rearranged during transfection (RET) proto-oncogene is the 
      major susceptibility gene for Hirschsprung disease, and germline mutations in RET 
      have been reported in up to 50% of the inherited forms of Hirschsprung disease and 
      in 15-20% of sporadic cases of Hirschsprung disease. The prevalence of Hirschsprung 
      disease in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 cases was recently determined to be 
      7.5% and the cooccurrence of Hirschsprung disease and multiple endocrine neoplasia 
      type 2 has been reported in at least 22 families so far. It was initially thought 
      that Hirschsprung disease could be due to disturbances in apoptosis or due to a 
      tendency of the mutated RET receptor to be retained in the Golgi apparatus. 
      Presently, there is strong evidence favoring the hypothesis that specific 
      inactivating haplotypes play a key role in the fetal development of congenital 
      megacolon/Hirschsprung disease. In the present study, we report the genetic findings 
      in a novel family with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2: a specific RET haplotype 
      was documented in patients with Hirschsprung disease associated with medullary 
      thyroid carcinoma, but it was absent in patients with only medullary thyroid 
      carcinoma. Despite the limited number of cases, the present data favor the 
      hypothesis that specific haplotypes not linked to RET germline mutations are the 
      genetic causes of Hirschsprung disease.

TI  - Current mechanism of acquired resistance to epidermal growth factor 
      receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors and updated therapy strategies in human nonsmall 
      cell lung cancer.
PG  - C131-C137
LID - 10.4103/0973-1482.200613 [doi]
AB  - Lung cancer continues to be a major health problem and the most common 
      cancer-related mortality worldwide with about 80%-85% patients suffering from 
      nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). More than 80% of NSCLC cases are often diagnosed 
      as advanced stage and harbor epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activating 
      mutation. Although great success in initial response to EGFR-tyrosine kinase 
      inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) are found in EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients, acquired resistance 
      usually occurs on the continuous treatment. Here, we provide an overview on the 
      mechanism of acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC therapy as well as current 
      preclinical and clinical evidence of new therapy strategies and inhibitors in the 
      treatment of NSCLC. Many studies have shown that original or induced T790M mutation, 
      human EGFR 2 amplification, and activated secondary signaling such as MET 
      amplification or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase mutation can lead to acquired 
      resistance to EGFR-TKIs. In addition, transformation from NSCLC to SCLC or conferred 
      epithelial to mesenchymal transition has also been identified as mechanisms of 
      acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs. Increasing evidence has proven that non-coding RNA 
      including long noncoding RNAs and microRNAs or new EGFR mutation is involved in 
      acquired resistance. Preclinical and clinical Phase 1-3 evidence on combination drug 
      therapy or new generation inhibitors with different tumor-targeting approaches have 
      made those strategies the promising options for EGFR-TKI-resistant NSCLC therapy. 
      This review aims to get deep insight into providing a state-of-the-art overview of 
      the recent advances in the mechanisms of acquired resistance and new strategies for 
      targeted cancer therapy in EGFR-TKI-resistant NSCLC.

AB  - Historically, red cell mass (RCM) measurement has been promoted as an accurate 
      indicator of the body's red cell content. Both the Polycythemia Vera Study Group and 
      a committee sponsored by the World Health Organization have endorsed its inclusion 
      in their diagnostic criteria without supporting evidence of diagnostic accuracy from 
      a systematic study. Over the years, it has become evident that RCM measurement is a 
      cumbersome and costly test and, as a result, it has been abandoned by many 
      hematologists in practice. The recent discovery that a somatic JAK2-activating 
      mutation, JAK2(V617F), is almost invariably associated with polycythemia vera 
      further supports the use of diagnostic algorithms that are based on biologic 
      parameters in place of traditional diagnostic criteria that are based on RCM 
      measurement. Therefore, a contemporary approach to the diagnosis of polycythemia 
      vera starts with peripheral blood mutation screening for JAK2(V617F) as well as 
      measurement of serum erythropoietin. The results of these tests, along with the 
      clinical scenario, determine the need for further investigation, including bone 
      marrow examination.

PG  - 104-9
AB  - The oncogenic mechanisms of renal cell carcinoma(RCC) are becoming elucidated with 
      recent advances in molecular biology. von Hipple-Lindau disease(VHL) tumor 
      suppressor gene is mutated and inactivated frequently in clear cell type RCCs. The 
      VHL protein forms a complex which shows a ubiquitin ligase activity. The lost of the 
      ubiquitin ligase activity of VHL protein may be a key step for clear cell 
      tumorigenesis. Papillary renal cell carcinomas are caused by activating mutation in 
      the tyrosine kinase domain of the MET gene. This tumorigenic pathway is regulated by 
      c-Src. Immunogene therapies have been started for the patients with advanced RCC. 
      The information based on microarray and Serial Analysis of Gene Expression(SAGE) 
      will provide novel diagnosis and therapy which focus on the tumorigenic mechanism of 
      RCC in the near future.

TI  - [Molecular pathways of pancreatic carcinogenesis].
PG  - 349-55
AB  - Pancreatic carcinogenesis is still not well characterized and no specific carcinogen 
      has been isolated in humans. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma acquires genetic 
      abnormalities with successive modification of genes involved in the regulation of 
      cell proliferation and differentiation. The kinetic of genetic alterations in 
      pancreatic cancer is not totally elucidated but experimental pancreatic cancer 
      induced by BOP in Syrian golden hamster attempts to approach this problematic. The 
      activating mutation of the K-ras oncogene on codon 12 seems to occur early in 
      pancreatic carcinogenesis regarding the detection of this mutation in preneoplastic 
      dysplastic lesions and tumors such as intraductal mucinous papillary tumors. Tumor 
      suppressor genes are also inactivated leading commonly to the loss of an inhibitory 
      function on cell proliferation. This inactivation occurs with gene mutation, 
      deletion or methylation on one chromosome arm associated with a loss of 
      heterozygosity: it concerns p53, p16/MTS-1, DPC-4/SMAD4. We recently characterized 
      the somatostatin receptor SST2 gene as a potential suppressor gene for pancreatic 
      carcinoma. The kinetic of these gene alterations is unknown in human. At a late 
      stage of tumor development, an increase of telomerase activity, an over expression 
      of growth factors and/or their receptors (EGF, NGF, gastrin, bombesin), of 
      proangiogenic factors (VEGF, FGF, PDGF), of invasiveness factors 
      (metalloproteinases, E-cadherin, urokinase and tissue plasminogen activators) occur. 
      All these molecular events contribute to the progression and to the metastatic 
      potential of this carcinoma. Recently, the identification of human genome and the 
      large scale analysis of transcriptoma will certainly authorize a better knowledge of 
      pancreatic carcinogenesis as well as the identification of new genetic alterations 
      and new clinical markers.

PG  - 1061-9
LID - 10.1200/JCO.2012.43.4522 [doi]
AB  - Worldwide, the majority of patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
      do not have activating mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal 
      growth factor receptor (EGFR). These wild-type patients comprise a significant 
      proportion of those treated with inhibitors of this pathway, and data from 
      randomized trials suggest that some of these wild-type patients will derive a modest 
      benefit from these agents. Although the detection of an activating mutation predicts 
      for a greater likelihood of response and longer progression-free survival from an 
      EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, currently there are no biomarkers that consistently 
      and reproducibly predict for lack of benefit in wild-type patients. Several 
      strategies to increase the efficacy of these inhibitors in wild-type NSCLC are the 
      subject of ongoing investigations.

TI  - [Research advance on the pathogenesis of T-ALL induced by notch 1 activating 
      mutations].
PG  - 242-5
AB  - T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is the hematological malignancy of bone 
      marrow characterized by the rapid proliferation and subsequent accumulation of 
      immature T lymphocyte and mainly occurs in children and adolescents. In 1991, a kind 
      of activating mutation of Notch 1 was found in a subset of T-ALL with chromosomal 
      translocation t(7;9) for the first time. During the past 20 years since then, 
      understanding of the relationship between Notch 1 activating mutation and T-ALL has 
      been deepened and widened. This review briefly discusses the four main subtypes of 
      Notch 1 activating mutations, also focuses on how these mutations change the normal 
      signaling pathways and genes expression during their participation in the 
      pathogenesis of T-ALL, and how these insights will promote the development of newly 
      targeting therapies for patients with this aggressive form of leukemia.

AB  - The discovery of mutated oncogenes has opened up a new era for the development of 
      more effective treatments for non-small cell lung cancer patients (NSCLC) harbouring 
      EGFR mutations. However, patients with EGFR-activating mutation ultimately develop 
      acquired resistance (AR). Several studies have identified some of the mechanisms 
      involved in the development of AR to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) that can 
      be potential therapeutic strategies, although in up to 30% of cases, the underlying 
      mechanism of AR are still unexplained. In this review we aim to summarize the main 
      mechanisms of AR to EGFR TKI and some clinical strategies that can be used in the 
      daily clinical practice to overcome this resistance and try to prolong the outcomes 
      in this subgroup of patients.

TI  - P53 expression in altered limbal basal cells of pingueculae, pterygia, and limbal 
      tumors.
PG  - 1179-92
AB  - PURPOSE: We previously discovered that the pathogenesis of pterygia was due to a 
      vimentin-expressing, altered limbal epithelial basal cell, the pterygium cell. Since 
      UV radiation epidemiologically correlates as the etiologic agent for pterygia and 
      limbal tumors and is mutagenic for the p53 gene, our goal was to search for p53 gene 
      mutations immunohistochemically in the altered limbal basal cells of these growths 
      and of pingueculae from which they seem to originate. METHODS: Longitudinal serial 
      sections through six pingueculae, 14 primary and five recurrent pterygia, and five 
      limbal tumors were studied immunohistochemically with p53 monoclonal antibody DO-1 
      and, in some specimens, with antivimentin antibody. RESULTS: P53 expression was 
      found in the limbal cells of all pterygia, limbal tumors, and Stage II pingueculae, 
      but not in normal limbal-corneal epithelial cells. However, when the same specimens 
      were examined with a TUNEL assay, few if any apoptotic cells were found. A finding 
      of increased nuclear p53 gene product with little or no apoptosis is consistent with 
      an activating mutation of the p53 gene, resulting in increased steady-state levels 
      of the protein. CONCLUSIONS: The finding of increased nuclear p53 in the limbal 
      epithelium of pterygia, limbal tumors, and most pingueculae indicates the probable 
      existence of p53 mutations in these cells as an early event in their development, 
      which is consistent with their causation by UV radiation causation. In addition, due 
      to a damaged p53-dependent programmed cell death mechanism, mutations in other genes 
      are progressively acquired which allows the multi-step development of pterygia and 
      limbal tumor cells from p53 positive cells overlying a Stage II pinguecula. 
      Similarly, a pterygium dysplasia could arise from a pterygium cell. A classification 
      for limbal basal cell tumors is proposed, and the different stromal changes in 
      pingueculae, pterygia, and limbal tumors are identified. Two cell types were also 
      identified: a p53-positive pinguecula limbal epithelial cell (a pinguecula II cell) 
      and a p53-positive pterygium dysplasia cell (pterygium dysplasia cell).

TI  - The Biology of Classic Hairy Cell Leukemia.
LID - 10.3390/ijms22157780 [doi]
LID - 7780
AB  - Classic hairy cell leukemia (HCL) is a rare mature B-cell malignancy associated with 
      pancytopenia and infectious complications due to progressive infiltration of the 
      bone marrow and spleen. Despite tremendous therapeutic advances achieved with the 
      implementation of purine analogues such as cladribine into clinical practice, the 
      culprit biologic alterations driving this fascinating hematologic disease have long 
      stayed concealed. Nearly 10 years ago, BRAF V600E was finally identified as a key 
      activating mutation detectable in almost all HCL patients and throughout the entire 
      course of the disease. However, additional oncogenic biologic features seem 
      mandatory to enable HCL transformation, an open issue still under active 
      investigation. This review summarizes the current understanding of key pathogenic 
      mechanisms implicated in HCL and discusses major hurdles to overcome in the context 
      of other BRAF-mutated malignancies.

      showed that of the tumors containing transforming activity, in more than 75% of the 
      cases this activity segregated with either K-ras or the N-ras gene. H-ras activity 
      was never detected. The genetic background of the host influenced susceptibility to 
      tumor induction and oncogene activation. The K-ras gene was preferentially activated 
      over the N-ras gene (approximately 2:1) whether the inducing agent was radiation or 
      the chemical N-nitrosomethylurea. The activating mutation for the K-ras gene was 
      consistently identified as a GGT to GAT transition in codon 12. In contrast, several 
      different mutations of the N-ras gene were identified and localized to codons 12, 
      13, or 61. Assessment of the allelic composition of the ras locus shows that some 
      proportion of the tumors lost the normal ras allele.

TI  - Mazabraud syndrome in two patients: clinical overlap with McCune-Albright syndrome.
PG  - 132-6
AB  - Mazabraud syndrome is a rare sporadic disorder, mainly characterized by bone fibrous 
      dysplasia and intramuscular myxomas. We report here two new cases of Mazabraud 
      syndrome. One of our patients (Patient 1) also had café-au-lait spots and 
      multinodular goiter suggestive of McCune-Albright syndrome. We review the 37 
      previously reported cases with Mazabraud syndrome and discuss the 6/37 patients with 
      criteria of Mazabraud and McCune-Albright syndromes. Based on the clinical overlap 
      between the two syndromes, we tested the GNAS1 gene in blood leukocytes and skin 
      fibroblasts of Patient 1, but found no evidence of an activating mutation in the 
      GNAS1 gene.

PG  - 316-21
LID - 10.1007/s00508-011-1573-8 [doi]
AB  - Patients with stage IIIB and IV non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) harboring an 
      activating mutation of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) Gene should be 
      treated first-line with Gefitinib, an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). EGF 
      receptor mutations are most common in adenocarcinomas, especially non-mucinous type, 
      rare in squamous cell carcinomas and sarcomatoid carcinomas, and do not occur in 
      neuroendocrine carcinomas. Therefore, the Pulmonary Pathology Working Group of the 
      Austrian Society of Pathology, after intense discussions and in consensus with 
      Oncologists and Pulmonologists, recommends a priori EGFR mutation analysis for all 
      cases of adenocarcinoma, and for all other NSCLC upon clinical request. This will 
      markedly reduce waiting time for those patients, which most likely will have the 
      greatest benefit from EGFR TKI therapy.

TI  - Putting the bits and pieces of the RET proto-oncogene puzzle together.
PG  - 13S-16S
AB  - The RET proto-oncogene has been implicated in the causation of papillary thyroid 
      carcinoma, multiple endocrine neoplasia types 2A (MEN 2A) and 2B (MEN 2B), and 
      Hirschsprung's disease. The mutations in these syndromes can be categorized into 
      activating or inactivating mutations. Activating mutations of a cysteine-rich 
      extracellular region cause enhanced dimerization of the RET tyrosine kinase receptor 
      and autophosphorylation, and are causative for MEN 2A and familial medullary thyroid 
      carcinoma (FMTC). An activating mutation of the tyrosine kinase domain causes 
      increased autophosphorylation but does not affect the state of dimerization. A 
      variety of inactivating mutations of the RET proto-oncogene, which result in 
      defective protein formation, are causative for Hirschsprung's disease.

TI  - Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Expression and Resistance Patterns to Targeted 
      Therapy in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: A Review.
LID - 10.3390/cells10051206 [doi]
LID - 1206
AB  - Globally, lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death. The majority of 
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumours express epidermal growth factor receptor 
      (EGFR), which allows for precise and targeted therapy in these patients. The 
      dysregulation of EGFR in solid epithelial cancers has two distinct mechanisms: 
      either a kinase-activating mutation in EGFR (EGFR-mutant) and/or an overexpression 
      of wild-type EGFR (wt-EGFR). The underlying mechanism of EGFR dysregulation 
      influences the efficacy of anti-EGFR therapy as well as the nature of resistance 
      patterns and secondary mutations. This review will critically analyse the mechanisms 
      of EGFR expression in NSCLC, its relevance to currently approved targeted treatment 
      options, and the complex nature of secondary mutations and intrinsic and acquired 
      resistance patterns in NSCLC.

PG  - 2335-42
AB  - Revolution in biotechnology made possible to identify those gene errors, which via 
      their encoded proteins (mostly kinase enzymes) are key players in tumor development, 
      growth and progression, and could be considered as molecular targets in tumor 
      diagnosis and therapy. Activity of EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor), an 
      outstanding representative of the regulatory cell surface receptors, can be 
      inhibited by drugs proved for clinical use. In the past year many groups observed 
      that those lung adenocarcinoma cells, which contain activating mutation in the 
      tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR show remarkable sensitivity to anti-EGFR compounds. 
      The basis of the effective therapy is the identification of the mutations. The 
      clinical advantage of EGFR is an example from the coming age of tumor chemotherapy, 
      when the presence of molecular targets will guide the therapeutic choice.

TI  - [Small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors of epidermal growth factor receptor 
      (EGFR)].
PG  - 1058-62
AB  - Five years have passed since the activating mutation of the epidermal growth factor 
      receptor (EGFR) gene was discovered. Patients with lung cancer harboring EGFR 
      mutation respond remarkably well to small molecules, such as gefitinib or erlotinib, 
      that specifically inhibit tyrosine kinase of the EGFR. Furthermore, recent evidence 
      leads strong support to the idea that EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors prolong 
      survival of lung cancer patients with EGFR mutation. It has been also shown that 
      secondary mutation of the EGFR gene and amplification of the MET gene are 
      responsible for acquired resistance that emerges in virtually all cases treated with 
      EGFR-TKI. Strategies to circumvent this resistance is currently in development. It 
      is possible to personalize lung cancer therapy using the genetic information.

TI  - [Illicit hormone receptors in adrenal Cushing's syndrome].
PG  - 185-8
AB  - Recent studies from several groups have indicated that abnormal or ectopic 
      expression and function of adrenal receptors for various hormones may regulate 
      cortisol production in ACTH-independent hypercortisolism. GIP-dependent Cushing's 
      syndrome has been described in patients with either unilateral adenomas or bilateral 
      macronodular adrenal hyperplasia; this syndrome results from the adrenal 
      overexpression of the GIP receptor, which was found to be without an activating 
      mutation. An increased stimulation of cortisol secretion following administration of 
      vasopressin was also reported by several investigators in patients with adrenal 
      Cushing's syndrome; this was linked to an increased expression or abnormal response 
      of the V1-vasopressin receptor. We have conducted a prospective in vivo evaluation 
      of 20 patients with adrenal Cushing's syndrome in order to identify the presence of 
      abnormal hormone receptors. In 6 cases of macronodular adrenal hyperplasia, we have 
      identified, in addition to 2 cases of GIP-dependent Cushing's syndrome, 4 other 
      patients in whom cortisol production was regulated abnormally either by vasopressin, 
      B-adrenergic receptor agonists, hCG/LH, or serotonin 5-HT-4 receptor agonists. In 13 
      patients with unilateral adrenal adenoma, an abnormal response to a mixed meal or to 
      vasopressin was found in 3 cases, suggesting that the presence of ectopic or 
      abnormal hormone receptors is less prevalent than in macronodular adrenal 
      hyperplasia. The identification of the presence of an abnormal adrenal receptor 
      offers the possibility of a new pharmacological approach to control hypercortisolism 
      by suppressing the endogenous ligands or by using specific antagonists of the 
      abnormal receptors.

TI  - Signal transduction as target of gene therapy.
PG  - 63-71
AB  - Cancer development involves multistep events. Therapeutic approaches can be targeted 
      against any of these events individually or in combination. Pancreatic cancer can 
      involve activation of Ki-Ras, overexpression of Myc or ErbB-2, and mutational 
      inactivation of functional p53. Three approaches with nucleic acid-based therapies 
      have been taken. A ribozyme specific for Ki-ras mRNA carrying the activating 
      mutation in codon 12 (GGU to GUU) was designed and shown to be stimulated by 
      interaction with an RNA-binding protein NCp7 of HIV-1. The same protein was targeted 
      to cell-adhesion molecules, which allowed transfer of the ribozyme and an antisense 
      oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) into the cell. Furthermore, proliferation may be 
      prevented by blocking signal transduction. A transdominant negative mutant of the 
      signaling kinase c-Raf-1 efficiently blocked transmission. A retroviral vector will 
      be used as carrier. Furthermore, the concept of using naked DNA injected 
      intramuscularly as an immunogen against cancer is discussed.

AB  - We identified a papillary carcinoma in an 11-year-old girl with a hyperfunctioning 
      thyroid nodule. A met453thr mutation in TSHR was found in the nodule but not in 
      normal thyroid tissue or in leukocytes. This case documents that this activating 
      mutation is associated with neoplasia.
