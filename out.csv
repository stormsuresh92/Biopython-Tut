Glaucoma may be present at birth or develop later. Neuroimaging studies show leptomeningeal angiomatosis, supporting diagnosis. Standard treatment for Sturge-Weber syndrome includes laser treatment for the Port-wine stain, anticonvulsants, and medical or surgical treatment for the glaucoma. Prognosis depends on the extent of leptomeningeal involvement and the severity of the glaucoma.","['Higueros E', 'Roe E', 'Granell E', 'Baselga E']","['Servicio de Dermatología, Hospital Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona, España.', 'Servicio de Dermatología, Hospital Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona, España.', 'Servicio de Radiología, Hospital Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona, España.', 'Servicio de Dermatología, Hospital Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona, España.

GISTs occur throughout the intestinal tract, and most harbor an activating mutation in either KIT or platelet-derived growth factor A ( PDGFRA). Diagnosis is made using immunohistochemistry, but molecular testing with mutation analysis is paramount for selection of appropriate therapy. Most small GISTs are cured with surgery. Tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy has led to substantial improvements in survival, both for patients with localized GIST and those with advanced disease. Adjuvant therapy with imatinib benefits patients with a high risk of recurrence, with studies suggesting most benefit with at least 3 years of therapy. Neoadjuvant imatinib therapy should be considered for patients requiring extensive surgery, aiming at shrinking the tumor to allow organ preservation and less extensive surgery. The following three TKIs have been approved for the management of advanced disease: imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib; imatinib is usually the best tolerated of the three and the standard first-line treatment. TKIs benefit the majority of patients with advanced GIST but have no or limited efficacy in patients with the PDGFRA D842V mutation or patients with GIST lacking KIT and PDGFRA mutations. Surgery, the mainstay of primary tumor management, also plays a role in the advanced disease setting for selected patients, as do some other approaches such as palliative radiation therapy. Research continues to identify novel therapies, in particular effective agents to treat TKI-refractory disease.","['von Mehren M', 'Joensuu H']","['Margaret von Mehren, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA; and Heikki Joensuu, Helsinki University Hospital and University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Margaret von Mehren, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA; and Heikki Joensuu, Helsinki University Hospital and University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.']"

Hypoglycemia may be related to treatment of diabetes, but also to drugs, alcohol, critical illness, cortisol insufficiency including hypopituitarism, insulinoma, bariatric or gastric surgery, pancreas transplantation or glucagon deficiency, or may be surreptitious. Some hypoglycemic episodes remain unexplained, and genetic, paraneoplastic and immune causes should be considered. Genetic causes may be related to endogenous hyperinsulinism and to inborn errors of metabolism (IEM). Endogenous hyperinsulinism is related to monogenic congenital hyperinsulinism, and especially to mutations of the glucokinase-activating gene or of insulin receptors, both characterised by postprandial hypoglycemia with major hyperinsulinism. In adulthood, IEM-related hypoglycemia can persist in a previously diagnosed childhood disease or may be a presenting sign. It is suggested by systemic involvement (rhabdomyolysis after fasting or exercising, heart disease, hepatomegaly), sometimes associated to a family history of hypoglycemia. The timing of hypoglycemic episodes with respect to the last meal also helps to orientate diagnosis. Fasting hypoglycemia may be related to type 0, I or III glycogen synthesis disorder, fatty acid oxidation or gluconeogenesis disorder. Postprandial hypoglycemia may be related to inherited fructose intolerance. Exercise-induced hyperinsulinism is mainly related to activating mutation of the SLC16A1 gene. Besides exceptional ectopic insulin secretion, paraneoplastic causes involve NICTH (Non-Islet-Cell Tumour Hypoglycemia), caused by Big-IGF2 secretion by a large tumour, with low blood levels of insulin, C-peptide and IGF1. Autoimmune causes involve antibodies against insulin (HIRATA syndrome), especially in case of Graves' disease, or against the insulin receptor.

The homeostatic microenvironment chemokine CXCL12 binds the CXCR4 and CXCR7 receptors, activating divergent signals on multiple pathways, such as ERK1/2, p38, SAPK/JNK, AKT, mTOR, and the Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK). An activating mutation in CXCR4 is responsible for a rare disease, WHIM syndrome (warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, infections, and myelokathexis), and dominant CXCR4 mutations have also been reported in Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia. The CXCR4-CXCL12 axis regulates the hematopoietic stem cell niche--a property that has led to the approval of the CXCR4 antagonist plerixafor (AMD3100) for mobilization of hematopoietic precursors. In preclinical models, plerixafor has shown antimetastatic potential in vivo, offering proof of concept. Other antagonists are in preclinical and clinical development. Recent evidence demonstrates that inhibiting CXCR4 signaling restores sensitivity to CTLA-4 and PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors, creating a new line for investigation.

In early-stage setting, the identification of the BRAF mutation does not impact the therapeutic decision. Yet, the BRAF mutation could be considered as a stratification factor in adjuvant trials, because of its prognostic impact after relapse. Moreover, both BRAF mutation and mismatch repair (MMR) statuses should be determined in all CRC to help identify sporadic tumors versus Lynch syndrome-related tumors. Indeed, in patients with MMR-deficient (dMMR) tumors and MLH1 loss of expression, the BRAFV600E mutation indicates a sporadic origin. In advanced BRAF-mutated CRC, the standard of care remains fluoropyrimidine-based cytotoxic regimen in combination with bevacizumab. Although a recent meta-analysis showed that there was insufficient data to justify the exclusion of anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies, antiangiogenic agents should be preferred in the first-line setting. Despite the lack of a randomized phase 3 study dedicated to BRAF-mutated CRC, chemotherapy intensification combining a quadruple association of 5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, irinotecan (FOLFOXIRI), and bevacizumab seems like a valid option. Although first results with BRAF inhibitors as single agents in BRAF-mutated CRC were disappointing, their association with therapies targeting the MAPK pathway seems to overcome the primary resistance to BRAF inhibition. In the field of sporadic CRC, the BRAF mutation is strongly associated with MMR deficiency. Considering breakthrough results of immune checkpoint inhibitors in dMMR repair tumors, determination of the MMR status appears to be mandatory. Given the dramatic prognosis conferred by the BRAF mutation, patients with BRAF-mutated advanced CRC need to be systematically identified and proposed for clinical trial enrolment in order to benefit from innovative therapies.","['Cohen R', 'Cervera P', 'Svrcek M', 'Pellat A', 'Dreyer C', 'de Gramont A', 'André T']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Saint-Antoine Hospital, APHP, 184 rue du Faubourg Saint-Antoine, 75012, Paris, France.', 'Department of Pathology, Saint-Antoine Hospital, APHP, 184 rue du Faubourg Saint-Antoine, 75012, Paris, France.', 'Department of Pathology, Saint-Antoine Hospital, APHP, 184 rue du Faubourg Saint-Antoine, 75012, Paris, France.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Saint-Antoine Hospital, APHP, 184 rue du Faubourg Saint-Antoine, 75012, Paris, France.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Saint-Antoine Hospital, APHP, 184 rue du Faubourg Saint-Antoine, 75012, Paris, France.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Institut Hospitalier Franco-Britannique, 4 rue Kléber, 92300, Levallois-Perret, France.', 'GERCOR, Oncology Multidisciplinary Group, 151 rue du Faubourg Saint Antoine, 75011, Paris, France.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Saint-Antoine Hospital, APHP, 184 rue du Faubourg Saint-Antoine, 75012, Paris, France. thierry.andre@aphp.fr.', 'GERCOR, Oncology Multidisciplinary Group, 151 rue du Faubourg Saint Antoine, 75011, Paris, France. thierry.andre@aphp.fr.']"

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors have provided an illustrative example of the successes in targeting oncogene addiction in cancer and the role of tumor-specific adaptations conferring therapeutic resistance. The compound osimertinib is a third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which was granted full FDA approval in March 2017 based on targeting EGFR T790M resistance. The compound has received additional FDA approval as first-line therapy with improvement in progression-free survival by suppressing the activating mutation and preventing the rise of the dominant resistance clone. Drug development has been breathtaking in this space with other third-generation compounds at various stages of development: rociletinib (CO-1686), olmutinib (HM61713), nazartinib (EGF816), naquotinib (ASP8273), mavelertinib (PF-0647775), and AC0010. However, therapeutic resistance after the administration of third-generation inhibitors is complex and not fully understood, with significant intertumoral and intratumoral heterogeneity. Repeat tissue and plasma analyses on therapy have revealed insights into multiple mechanisms of resistance, including novel second site EGFR mutations, activated bypass pathways such as MET amplification, HER2 amplification, RAS mutations, BRAF mutations, PIK3CA mutations, and novel fusion events. Strategies to understand and predict patterns of mutagenesis are still in their infancy; however, technologies to understand synthetically lethal dependencies and track cancer evolution through therapy are being explored. The expansion of combinatorial therapies is a direction forward targeting minimal residual disease and bypass pathways early based on projected resistance.","['Murtuza A', 'Bulbul A', 'Shen JP', 'Keshavarzian P', 'Woodward BD', 'Lopez-Diaz FJ', 'Lippman SM', 'Husain H']","['University of California San Diego, Moores Cancer Center, La Jolla, California.', 'University of California San Diego, Moores Cancer Center, La Jolla, California.', 'University of California San Diego, Moores Cancer Center, La Jolla, California.', 'University of California San Diego, Moores Cancer Center, La Jolla, California.', 'University of California San Diego, Moores Cancer Center, La Jolla, California.', 'University of California San Diego, Moores Cancer Center, La Jolla, California.', 'University of California San Diego, Moores Cancer Center, La Jolla, California.', 'University of California San Diego, Moores Cancer Center, La Jolla, California. hhusain@ucsd.edu.']"

Even though the two molecular mechanisms differ, their signalling pathways, implicated in malignant transformation of colonic epithelial cells, appear to be similar. The most frequent group of CRC, which represents 80% of sporadic CRC, is characterized by allelic losses on the short arm of chromosome 17 and 8 and on the long arm of chromosome 5, 18 and 22. These allelic losses are associated with mutations in TP53, APC, SMAD2 and SMAD4 genes. All of these alterations are grouped under the phenotype CIN. A genetic instability termed MSI (microsatellite instability), which results from a mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency, appears in 12-15% of CRC cases. The presence of MMR deficiency leads to the accumulation of mutations in genes controlling cell cycle and apoptosis (TGFBRII, BAX or CASPASE5). More recently, the existence of a third phenotype was suggested. The main alteration associated with this group of tumors is the hypermethylation of the promoter region of numerous genes, leading to their inactivation. An activating mutation of BRAF is frequently associated with this phenotype. As described above, CRC shows genetic heterogeneity, however the consequences in terms of signalling pathway alterations are similar. For example, the activation of Wnt signalling pathways can result from the inactivation of the APC gene in the CIN phenotype or from an activating mutation in the β-catenin gene in MSI tumors. The inactivation of TGFβ pathways is also present in both tumor types and is driven by SMAD4, and more rarely by a SMAD2 inactivating mutation in CIN tumors, or by the existence of a frame-shift mutation occurring in a polyG coding track of the TGFβ (transforming growth factor) receptor type II in MSI tumors. The RAS-MAP kinase pathway is activated by KRAS mutations in CIN tumors or by BRAF mutations in MSI tumors. The p53 pathway is inactivated by TP53 inactivation in CIN tumors or by BAX inactivating mutations in MSI tumors.","['Laurent-Puig P', 'Agostini J', 'Maley K']","['Université Paris-Descartes, UMR-S775, Pôle de Biologie, Hôpital Européen Georges-Pompidou AP-HP, Paris, France. pierre.laurent-puig@parisdescartes.fr']"

In 2005, a somatic activating mutation in the JAK2 nonreceptor tyrosine kinase (JAK2V617F) was identified in most patients with PV and in a significant proportion of patients with ET and PMF. Subsequent studies identified additional mutations in the JAK-STAT pathway in some patients with JAK2V617F(-) MPD, suggesting that constitutive activation of this signaling pathway is a unifying feature of these disorders. Although the discovery of mutations in the JAK-STAT pathway is important from a pathogenetic and diagnostic perspective, important questions remain regarding the role of this single disease allele in 3 related but clinically distinct disorders, and the role of additional genetic events in MPD disease pathogenesis. In addition, these observations provide a foundation for development of small molecule inhibitors of JAK2 that are currently being tested in clinical trials. This review will discuss our understanding of the pathogenesis of PV, ET, and PMF, the potential role of JAK2-targeted therapy, and the important unanswered questions that need to be addressed to improve clinical outcome.","['Levine RL', 'Gilliland DG']","['Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA. leviner@mskcc.org']"

The enigmatic pathogenesis of HCL was recently clarified by the discovery of its underlying genetic cause, the BRAF-V600E kinase-activating mutation, which is somatically and clonally present in almost all patients through the entire disease spectrum and clinical course. By aberrantly activating the RAF-MEK-ERK signaling pathway, BRAF-V600E shapes key biologic features of HCL, including its specific expression signature, hairy morphology, and antiapoptotic behavior. Accompanying mutations of the KLF2 transcription factor or the CDKN1B/p27 cell cycle inhibitor are recurrent in 16% of patients with HCL and likely cooperate with BRAF-V600E in HCL pathogenesis. Conversely, BRAF-V600E is absent in other B-cell neoplasms, including mimickers of HCL that require different treatments (eg, HCL-variant and splenic marginal zone lymphoma). Thus, testing for BRAF-V600E allows for a genetics-based differential diagnosis between HCL and HCL-like tumors, even noninvasively in routine blood samples. BRAF-V600E also represents a new therapeutic target. Patients' leukemic cells exposed ex vivo to BRAF inhibitors are spoiled of their HCL identity and then undergo apoptosis. In clinical trials of patients with HCL who have experienced multiple relapses after purine analogs or who are refractory to purine analogs, a short course of the oral BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib produced an almost 100% response rate, including complete remission rates of 35% to 42%, without myelotoxicity. To further improve on these results, it will be important to clarify the mechanisms of incomplete leukemic cell eradication by vemurafenib and to explore chemotherapy-free combinations of a BRAF inhibitor with other targeted agents (eg, a MEK inhibitor and/or an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody).","['Tiacci E', 'Pettirossi V', 'Schiavoni G', 'Falini B']","['All authors: Institute of Hematology and Center for Hemato-Oncology Research, University and Hospital of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'All authors: Institute of Hematology and Center for Hemato-Oncology Research, University and Hospital of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'All authors: Institute of Hematology and Center for Hemato-Oncology Research, University and Hospital of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'All authors: Institute of Hematology and Center for Hemato-Oncology Research, University and Hospital of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.']"

Overlap forms of histiocytoses are frequent. Technetium bone scintigraphy showing nearly constant tracer uptake by the long bones is highly suggestive of ECD and a 'hairy kidney' appearance on abdominal CT scan is observed in more than half ECD cases. CNS involvement is a strong prognostic factor and an independent predictor of death in cases of ECD. Optimal initial therapy for ECD appears to be administration of IFN-α (and/or pegylated IFN-α) and prolonged treatment significantly improves survival; however, tolerance may be poor. Best alternative therapies are anakinra, mainly effective for mild forms of the disease, infliximab, and sirolimus.

The pathways mediating OIS are complex and incompletely elucidated but, the proliferative arrest involves activation of both the RB and p53 pathways. In addition, whereas there are indications that at least in some situations, negative feedback loops abolish the increased mitogenic signaling resulting from the oncogenic mutations, also an unexpected contribution of interleukin-mediated signaling has recently been found. OIS brings about cessation of growth of some benign tumors, including melanocytic nevi and several other lesions, including pituitary and thyroid adenomas. It protects against progression to cancer, and in this way complements oncogene-induced apoptosis. Perhaps, OIS has evolved as an alternative to apoptosis especially regarding long-lived cell types that are not replaceable in large numbers. Contrary to the earlier belief, OIS is not entirely irreversible, at least in some well documented in vitro systems. This means that its induction does not entirely eliminate the oncogenic threat resulting from the mutated cell. It also means that OIS, or related phenomena that may affect a proportion of the tumor cells of some cancers, may have an influence on responsiveness to cytotoxic cancer therapies, because OIS is associated with an antiapoptosis phenotype.","['Chandeck C', 'Mooi WJ']","['Department of Pathology, VU University Medical Center Amsterdam, Netherlands.']"

They are mostly benign monoclonal neoplasms that arise from any of the five hormone-secreting cell types of the anterior pituitary gland.

Both functioning and non-functioning adenomas can produce symptoms or signs resulting from compression of the optic chiasm or invasion of cavernous sinuses. Only 5% of PA occur within the context of hereditary syndromes with reasonably well-defined oncogenic mechanisms. The vast majority of PA are sporadic, and their etiopathogenesis remains largely unknown. Pituitary tumor oncogenesis involves several mechanisms that eventually lead to abnormal cell proliferation and dysregulated hormone production.

The underlying molecular mechanisms of sclerosing mucoepidermoid carcinoma with eosinophilia tumorigenesis remain unknown. CASE PRESENTATION: We present two cases of sclerosing mucoepidermoid carcinoma with eosinophilia, both with a concurrent papillary thyroid carcinoma. Patient 1, a 70-year-old Caucasian woman, presented with sclerosing mucoepidermoid carcinoma with eosinophilia with distant renal metastasis and coexisting papillary thyroid carcinoma. Patient 2, a 74-year-old Caucasian woman with a remote history of thyroid cancer treated with thyroidectomy, presented with locoregionally invasive sclerosing mucoepidermoid carcinoma with eosinophilia and recurrent papillary thyroid carcinoma in the thyroid bed. BRAF mutation studies were performed on the sclerosing mucoepidermoid carcinoma with eosinophilia tumors. In both cases, sclerosing mucoepidermoid carcinoma with eosinophilia was positive for the BRAF V600E mutation by polymerase chain reaction. Patient 1 is the first reported case of sclerosing mucoepidermoid carcinoma with eosinophilia with renal metastasis, to the best of our knowledge. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest, for the first time, to our knowledge, involvement of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling pathway in the pathogenesis of sclerosing mucoepidermoid carcinoma with eosinophilia. Thus, BRAF inhibitors may prove to be a useful targeted medical therapy in the treatment of a subset of patients with aggressive sclerosing mucoepidermoid carcinoma with eosinophilia tumors who exhibit BRAF activating mutation.","['Sukumar JS', 'Sukumar S', 'Purohit D', 'Welch BJ', 'Balani J', 'Yan S', 'Hathiramani SS']","['Department of Internal Medicine, UT Southwestern Medical Center, 5323 Harry Hines Boulevard, Dallas, TX, 75390, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, UT Southwestern Medical Center, 5323 Harry Hines Boulevard, Dallas, TX, 75390, USA.', 'Department of Endocrinology, Capital Diabetes and Endocrine Associates, 5801 Allentown Road, Suite 500, Camp Springs, MD, 20746, USA.', 'Department of Endocrinology, Baylor University Medical Center, 3500 Gaston Avenue, Dallas, TX, 75246, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, UT Southwestern Medical Center, 5323 Harry Hines Boulevard, Dallas, TX, 75390, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, UT Southwestern Medical Center, 5323 Harry Hines Boulevard, Dallas, TX, 75390, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, UT Southwestern Medical Center, 5323 Harry Hines Boulevard, Dallas, TX, 75390, USA. sumitha.hathiramani@va.gov.', 'Division of Endocrinology, VA North Texas Healthcare System, 4500 South Lancaster Road, Dallas, TX, 75216, USA. sumitha.hathiramani@va.gov.']"

However, the most frequent somatic mutation, F1174L, is associated with amplification of the MYCN oncogene. This combination of features appears to confer a worse prognosis than MYCN amplification alone, suggesting a cooperative effect on neuroblastoma formation by these two proteins.

A somatic C-Kit mutation is usually detectable in mast cells and their progenitors. Different mutations were found and the mutation D816V is the most frequent. Their specific transduction paths were also studied.

At a late stage of tumor development, an increase of telomerase activity, an over expression of growth factors and/or their receptors (EGF, nerve growth factor, gastrin, bombesin), of proangiogenic factors (VEGF, FGF, PDGF), of invasiveness factors (metalloproteinases, E-cadherin, beta integrin, urokinase and tissue plasminogen activator) occur. All these molecular events contribute to the progression and to the metastatic potential of this carcinoma. New markers and targets are currently studied among microRNA and epigenetics events such as methylation and acetylation. Among all these molecular markers, some are now tested for their potential clinical interest in term of diagnosis or therapeutic target.","['Torrisani J', 'Bournet B', 'Cordelier P', 'Buscail L']","['Inserm U858, Institut de médecine moléculaire et Service de gastro-entérologie et nutrition, CHU Rangueil, TSA 50032, 31059 Toulouse Cedex 9.']"

Individual laboratories' expertise and the availability of appropriate equipment are valuable assets in predictive molecular pathology, although the choice of methods should be determined by the nature of the samples to be tested and whether the detection of only well-characterized EGFR mutations or rather, of all detectable mutations, is required. Areas covered: The EGFR mutation testing landscape is manifold and includes both screening and targeted methods, each with their own pros and cons. Here we review one of these companion tests, the Roche cobas® EGFR mutation test v2, from a methodological point of view, also exploring its liquid-biopsy applications. Expert commentary: The Roche cobas® EGFR mutation test v2, based on real time RT-PCR, is a reliable option for testing EGFR mutations in clinical practice, either using tissue-derived DNA or plasma-derived cfDNA. This application will be valuable for laboratories with whose purpose is purely diagnostic and lacking high-throughput technologies.","['Malapelle U', 'Sirera R', 'Jantus-Lewintre E', 'Reclusa P', 'Calabuig-Fariñas S', 'Blasco A', 'Pisapia P', 'Rolfo C', 'Camps C']","['a Department of Public Health , University of Naples Federico II , Naples , Italy.', 'b Department of Biotechnology , Universitat Politècnica de València , Valencia , Spain.', 'c Department of Medical Oncology , Hospital General Universitario de Valencia , Valencia , Spain.', 'd Molecular Oncology Laboratory , Fundación Hospital General Universitario de Valencia , Valencia , Spain.', 'b Department of Biotechnology , Universitat Politècnica de València , Valencia , Spain.', 'c Department of Medical Oncology , Hospital General Universitario de Valencia , Valencia , Spain.', 'd Molecular Oncology Laboratory , Fundación Hospital General Universitario de Valencia , Valencia , Spain.', 'e Phase I-Early Clinical Trials Unit, Oncology Department , Antwerp University Hospital , Antwerp , Belgium.', 'f Center for Oncological Research (CORE) , Antwerp University , Antwerp , Belgium.', 'c Department of Medical Oncology , Hospital General Universitario de Valencia , Valencia , Spain.', 'd Molecular Oncology Laboratory , Fundación Hospital General Universitario de Valencia , Valencia , Spain.', 'g Department of Pathology , Universitat de València , Valencia , Spain.', 'c Department of Medical Oncology , Hospital General Universitario de Valencia , Valencia , Spain.', 'a Department of Public Health , University of Naples Federico II , Naples , Italy.', 'e Phase I-Early Clinical Trials Unit, Oncology Department , Antwerp University Hospital , Antwerp , Belgium.', 'f Center for Oncological Research (CORE) , Antwerp University , Antwerp , Belgium.', 'c Department of Medical Oncology , Hospital General Universitario de Valencia , Valencia , Spain.', 'd Molecular Oncology Laboratory , Fundación Hospital General Universitario de Valencia , Valencia , Spain.', 'h Department of Medicine , Universitat de València , Valencia , Spain.', 'i CIBERONC , Valencia , Spain.']"

Imatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of KIT and PDGFRs that yields a 6-months progression-free survival (PFS) rate of 80 % in patients with advanced GISTs. Several studies have shown that response to imatinib in GIST patients mainly depends on the mutational status of KIT or PDGFR alpha. Moreover, most if not all patients treated with imatinib for advanced GIST will secondarily develop progressive disease under treatment. In the majority of cases, such progressions are the result of acquired resistance due to occurrence of secondary C-KIT mutations; especially for GIST with primary exon 11 mutations. Sunitinib is another approved drug and an inhibitor of multiple tyrosine kinases including KIT, PDGFR alpha as well as PDGFR beta and VEGFRs which are associated with angiogenesis. Sunitinib, in phase II and III trials was associated with durable clinical benefit in nearly 25 % of patients with advanced GIST resistant/intolerant to imatinib.

The discovery of an activating mutation (V617F) in the gene for JAK2 (Janus kinase 2), a tyrosine kinase utilized by hematopoietic cell receptors for erythropoietin, thrombopoietin, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, provided an explanation for the shared clinical features of these 3 disorders. Constitutive JAK2 activation provides a growth and survival advantage to the hematopoietic cells of the affected clone. Because signaling by the mutated kinase utilizes normal pathways, the result is overproduction of morphologically normal blood cells, an often indolent course, and (in essential thrombocytosis) usually a normal life span. Because the erythropoietin, thrombopoietin, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptors are all constitutively activated, polycythemia vera is the potential ultimate clinical phenotype of the JAK2 V617F mutation and, as a corollary, is the most common of the 3 disorders. The number of cells expressing the JAK2 V617F mutation (the allele burden) seems to correlate with the clinical phenotype. Preliminary results of clinical trials with agents that inhibit the mutated kinase indicate a reduction in splenomegaly and alleviation of night sweats, fatigue, and pruritus.",['Spivak JL'],"['Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, Maryland 21205-2196, USA. jlspivak@jhmi.edu']"

In the metastatic setting, the addition of the anti-vascular endothelial growth factor monoclonal antibody, bevacizumab, to chemotherapy improves overall survival. The oral epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors, gefitinib and erlotinib, prolong progression-free survival in patients selected for the presence of an EGFR activating mutation. The monoclonal antibody to EGFR, cetuximab, improves survival in patients with metastatic NSCLC, and the inhibitor of the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (EML4-ALK) fusion protein, crizotinib, has resulted in an unprecedented overall survival advantage in patients harboring the EML4-ALK translocation. In the adjuvant setting, gefitinib has not been shown to improve patient survival outcomes; however, there are several ongoing clinical trials in the adjuvant setting evaluating the role of erlotinib, bevacizumab, and the MAGE-A3 and MUC1 vaccines. The realm of personalized lung cancer therapy also includes the study of chemotherapy selected on the basis of the pharmacogenetic profile of a patient's tumor.

In pre-clinical models, a wide range of molecular mechanisms have been associated with reduced sensitivity to trastuzumab in vitro. These include expression of the truncated HER2 receptor fragment p95HER2, activating mutation of the gene encoding the class 1A catalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PIK3CA), loss of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), activation of other downstream signal transducers, prevention of cell cycle arrest, increased signaling through alternative (HER or non-HER) tyrosine kinase receptors, and resistance to antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. However, the clinical significance of these mechanisms as determinants of trastuzumab efficacy in vivo has been unclear. Here, we review clinical studies of potential predictive biomarkers of trastuzumab efficacy in HER2-positive breast cancer and consider whether evaluation of such markers might inform patient selection for therapy. We find that clinical evidence relating to potential predictive biomarkers is mostly limited to small, retrospective studies, many of which have yielded conflicting findings. Some trends are evident in the retrospective data and in biomarker analyses from randomized clinical trials, particularly relating to activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway, but none is sufficiently strong to form a basis for patient selection. This may be explained by the fact that multiple mechanisms of action determine the clinical efficacy of trastuzumab. In the absence of novel, validated biomarkers of efficacy, trastuzumab eligibility should continue to be based on evaluation of HER2 status according to standard methods.","['De P', 'Hasmann M', 'Leyland-Jones B']","['Edith Sanford Breast Cancer Center, Sanford Research/USD, Sioux Falls, SD, USA.

CRC induced by chemical carcinogens, such as heterocyclic aromatic amines and azoxymethane, in mice also involves dysregulation of Wnt signaling but via activating missense mutations in the β-catenin oncogene despite the fact that genetically modified mice harboring an inactive APC allele efficiently develop CRC. In contrast, activating mutations in β-catenin are rarely observed in human CRC. Dysregulation of the Wnt signaling pathway by the two distinct mechanisms reveals insights into the etiology of human CRC. On the basis of calculations related to DNA adduct levels produced in mouse CRC models using mutagens, and the number of stem cells in the mouse colon, we show that two nonsense mutations required for biallelic disruption of APC are statistically unlikely to produce CRC in experiments using small numbers of mice. We calculate that an activating mutation in one allele near the critical GSK3β phosphorylation site on β-catenin is >10(5)-times more likely to produce CRC by random mutagenesis due to chemicals than inactivating two alleles in APC, yet it does not occur in humans. Therefore, the mutagenesis mechanism in human CRC cannot be random. We explain that nonsense APC mutations predominate in human CRC because of deamination at 5-methylcytosine at CGA and CAG codons, coupled with the number of human colonic stem cells and lifespan. Our analyses, including a comparison of mutation type and age at CRC diagnosis in U.S. and Chinese patients, also indicate that APC mutations in CRC are not due to environmental mutagens that randomly damage DNA.","['Yang D', 'Zhang M', 'Gold B']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Pittsburgh , Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15261, United States.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Pittsburgh , Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15261, United States.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Pittsburgh , Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15261, United States.']"

Gefitinib and erlotinib are first generation clinically employed inhibitors used against EGFR activating mutants. However, during course of treatment these inhibitors become ineffective due to the emergence of an acquired secondary mutation. Subsequently, in order to overcome non-responsiveness second and third generation inhibitors were designed having covalent bond and irreversible mode of action. However, these inhibitors were shown to be toxic. This led to the discovery of lead candidates with completely different mode of action and therapeutic efficacy. OBJECTIVE: We have reviewed the recent efforts undertaken by researchers in discovering newer noncovalent reversible next generation inhibitors for treating NSCLC. METHODS: We first studied the optimization steps and pharmacokinetic variables of the synthesised molecules. We also analysed bonds and interactions using PDB X-ray crystal structures as well as scaffold and selectivity analysis was undertaken. RESULTS: We identified that ligand lipophilic efficiency driven potency is a preferable optimisation parameter for maintaining drug likeliness of the molecule. Also, few h-bonds were recognised as major players in affecting the binding of compound. The scaffold analysis revealed that ligand molecules with pyrimidine core exhibit higher inhibitory activity against TMLR, as well as higher selectivity with respect to other kinases. CONCLUSION: Next generation reversible inhibitors exhibited unique binding mode and were found to occupy three major pockets (ribose pocket, back pocket and hinge region), which is critical for increasing the selectivity of the compound against TMLR mutants.","['Agarwal SM', 'Pal D', 'Gupta M', 'Saini R']","['Bioinformatics Division, ICMR-Institute of Cytology and Preventive Oncology, I-7, Sector-39, Noida-201301.

Consequently, a substantial effort is now underway to identify additional therapeutically relevant kinase targets and to develop and test inhibitors of those proteins in a variety of human malignancies. However, it has also become clear that the clinical benefit associated with these agents is typically limited to a subset of treated patients, who in many cases are defined by a specific genomic lesion within their tumor cells--frequently, an activating mutation within the gene encoding the target kinase. This discovery has prompted efforts to stratify patients before treatment with kinase inhibitors based on specific genomic biomarkers, with the goal of optimizing clinical outcomes through the effective personalization of treatment (ie, matching the right patients with the right therapies). With recent advances in our understanding of the relationship between tumor genotypes and cancer cell sensitivity to kinase inhibition, together with improved technologies for rapidly genotyping tumor biopsies for relevant lesions, the implementation of personalized cancer care with this exciting new class of inhibitors is now becoming a reality.

Human parvovirus B19 infection may complicate the clinical course of patients with acute leukemia and may also precede the development of acute leukemia by up to 180 days. Parvovirus B19 targets erythroblasts in the bone marrow and may cause aplastic crisis in patients with shortened-red cell survival. Aplastic crisis represents a prodrome of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in 2% patients. There is a significant overlap between those HLA classes I and II alleles that are associated with a vigorous immune response and development of symptoms during B19 infection and those HLA alleles that predispose to development of acute leukemia. Acute symptomatic B19 infection is associated with low circulating IL-10 consistent with a vigorous immune response; deficient IL-10 production at birth was recently found to be associated with subsequent development of acute leukemia. Anti-B19 IgG has been associated with a particular profile of methylation of human cancer genes in patients with acute leukemia, suggesting an additional hit and run mechanism. The proposed role for parvovirus B19 in the pathogenesis of acute leukemia fits well with the delayed infection hypothesis and with the two-step mutation model, which describes carriage of the first mutation prior to birth, followed by suppression of hematopoiesis, which allows rapid proliferation of cells harboring the first mutation, acquisition of a second activating mutation, and expansion of cells carrying both mutations, resulting in acute leukemia.","['Kerr JR', 'Mattey DL']","['Escuela de Medicina y Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad del Rosario, Bogotá D.C., Colombia.']"

They are considered to originate from neoplastic transformation of either the intestinal pacemaker cells of Cajal or the precursor pluripotential stem cells. The genetic basis of GIST growth is an activating mutation of two receptor tyrosine kinases. Recent epidemiologic studies demonstrate that the GIST prevalence is approximately 20/1000000/year. Although GISTs develop in every part of the GI tract, stomach remains the most common localization. About 80 % of the patients experience tumor recurrence or hepatic metastasis after radical resection. GIST liver metastases are usually multiple, large in diameter, and localized in both lobes. In addition, GISTs are usually completely asymptomatic, discovered incidentally. Symptoms are not typical and depend on the location, size, and aggressiveness of the tumor. DISCUSSION: Diagnostic evaluation is based on imaging techniques, such as computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, and endoscopic ultrasound. Despite recent research on the therapeutic strategies against GISTs, surgical resection appears the only potentially curative approach. For the advanced metastatic disease, imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has been proposed neoadjuvantly with the surgery performed after the adequate reduction of tumor burden. The aim of this review was to evaluate the results of surgical treatment for metastatic GIST with special reference to the extent of its histological spread and to present the recent literature in order to provide an update on the current concepts of advanced surgical management of this entity.","['Mastoraki A', 'Toliaki E', 'Chrisovergi E', 'Mastoraki S', 'Papanikolaou IS', 'Danias N', 'Smyrniotis V', 'Arkadopoulos N']","['4th Department of Surgery, Medical School, ATTIKON University Hospital, Athens University, 1 Rimini str, 12462, Chaidari, Athens, Greece, dr_kamast@yahoo.gr.']"

Here, we provide an overview on the mechanism of acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC therapy as well as current preclinical and clinical evidence of new therapy strategies and inhibitors in the treatment of NSCLC. Many studies have shown that original or induced T790M mutation, human EGFR 2 amplification, and activated secondary signaling such as MET amplification or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase mutation can lead to acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs.

This will markedly reduce waiting time for those patients, which most likely will have the greatest benefit from EGFR TKI therapy.","['Popper H', 'Wrba F', 'Gruber-Mösenbacher U', 'Hulla W', 'Pirker R', 'Hilbe W', 'Studnicka M', 'Mohn-Staudner A', 'Ploner F']","['Institut für Pathologie, MedUni Graz, Graz, Austria. helmut.popper@medunigraz.at']"
